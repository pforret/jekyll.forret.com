I have been looking for a way to write down tango steps since I began dancing. I experimented with [drawing arrows](http://blog.forret.com/2005/02/tango-steps-and-twister/), writing full text, abbreviations, inventing signs, &#8230; I&#8217;m not alone in this quest:

And that is only when you take into account the feet. The [Labanotation](http://user.uni-frankfurt.de/~griesbec/LABANE.HTML) system (developed by professional dancers) has a graphical element for each movement of the legs and arms.

While this is probably one of the best systems around, it&#8217;s too complicated for us laymen dancers. So I decided to distill a base vocabulary for writing down tango steps: [Tangotation](http://tango.smoothouse.com/dance/Tangotation).

### Tangotation

Tangotation is an effort to standardize simple tango notation. It concentrates on the feet of both dancers. Let&#8217;s show an example:  
[Inverted base step](http://tango.smoothouse.com/dance/Paso_basico_tangotation) (8 count) 

<pre>LEAD  FOLLOW  
1  MRB  WLF  
2  MLS  WRS  
   -MRC   
3  MLF  WLB  
4  MRF  WRB  
       -WLBX  
6  MLF  WRB  
7  MRS  WLS  
8  MRC  WRC </pre>

Every step is described as a sequence of at least 3 letters: WLF is &#8216;woman (follower) &#8211; left (foot) &#8211; forward&#8217;, MRS is &#8216;man (leader) &#8211; right (foot) &#8211; sideways&#8217;.  
In WLBX, the extra X stands for [&#8216;Cross&#8217;/&#8217;Cruzada&#8217;](http://tango.smoothouse.com/dance/Cruzada) (foot crossed in front of the other).  
The leading &#8216;-&#8216; means that the step should be taken immediately after the previous one, not on a beat of its own. To sum it up:

> syntax: (`[-'])[MW][LR][FBSCP]([X8G...]`)
> 
>   * WHO: [M/W] &#8211; Man/Woman (or for the politically correct: Marca/counterpart) 
>   * WHAT: [L/R] &#8211; Left/Right foot 
>   * WHERE: [F/B/S/C/P] &#8211; Front, Back, Side, Close, change weight 
>   * WHEN: [-/&#8217;] ; every step is on the next beat unless &#8220;-&#8220;: link to previous step, &#8220;&#8216;&#8221;: link to next step 
>   * HOW: [X/8/G]: Cross (Cruzada), 8 (ocho), G (gancho) 
> 
> (from [Tangotation](http://tango.smoothouse.com/dance/Tangotation))

Each letter has one unambiguous meaning, the full [Tangotation alphabet](http://tango.smoothouse.com/dance/Tangotation_alphabet) is here.

I&#8217;ve even made a print-out form to allow easy notation:

(as a [JPG](http://www.flickr.com/photo_zoom.gne?id=140290664&size=o), as a [PDF](http://tango.smoothouse.com/doc/tangotation_a5.pdf))

This is just a first draft, so all input is appreciated!
