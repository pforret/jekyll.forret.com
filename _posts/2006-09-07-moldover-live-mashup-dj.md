I just found out via [beatmixed](http://www.beatmixed.com/2006/09/05/remashing-with-ableton) that there is a New-York DJ that has figured out the nuts and bolts: Toto a.k.a. [Moldover](http://www.moldover.com/).

### MOLDOVER SETUP

  * HARDWARE: He uses a PC laptop with [Ableton Live](http://www.ableton.com/live) (for loop control) and [Native Instruments Reaktor](http://www.native-instruments.com/index.php?id=reaktor5_us) (for sound FX). As MIDI-controller, he uses a [Novation ReMOTE 25](http://www.novationmusic.com/product.asp?id=30&Type=1&bArchive=False) (2 octaves). For audio output he uses an [Echo Audio Indigo » io](http://www.echoaudio.com/Products/CardBus/IndigoIO/index.php) CardBus interface.
  * SOFTWARE: he has organized an extensive collection of loops in Live into 8 columns or channels &#8211; I think &#8220;DJ1&#8221;, &#8220;DJ2&#8221;, &#8220;Beats&#8221;, &#8220;Percussion&#8221;, &#8220;Melody&#8221;, &#8220;Bass&#8221;, &#8220;Ambient&#8221; and &#8220;Vocals&#8221;. Loops are color-coded for the key they&#8217;re in (if any). Each channel has 1 FX configured which is the Reaktor plugin. There are also some effects on the master output (limiter, compressor, &#8230;)
  * CONTROL: he uses the 8 white keys at the right to trigger each channel. The 8 sliders, which are nicely lined up right above the keys, control the volume of each channel. The 2 x 8 knobs control 2 FX settings per channel. On some channels these are equalizer settings (cut-off frequency), on others delay/reverb settings (depends on the type of &#8216;content&#8217; of each channel, and what FX go best with that).

### PRICING

Let&#8217;s estimate what a set-up like this would cost:

  * laptop: you want plenty of memory (2GB) and CPU (Core Duo 2GHz), so something like a Dell Inspiron 9400 (1800 €) or Precision M90 (2000 €)
  * Novation ReMOTE SL 25: [550 €](http://www.piens.be/prices/index.lasso?id=5&a=043238)
  * Ableton Live: [500 €](http://www.ableton.com/live6-pricing)
  * Native Instruments Reaktor: [400 €](http://www.native-instruments.com/index.php?id=shopdetail_us&prid=530&backPID=1244)
  * Echo Audio Indigo io: 230 €

So a total of 3000 to 4000 €. Some ways to make the price tag less aggressive: a [Behringer BCF2000](http://www.behringer.com/BCF2000/index.cfm?lang=ENG) instead of the Novation, [Behringer F-control](http://www.behringer.com/FCA202/index.cfm?lang=ENG) instead of the Echo Audio (using the laptop&#8217;s internal line-out is probably not a viable option, and the F-control comes with a lite edition of Ableton Live 4, maybe enough to get started) and start without Reaktor. Or go for one of the Live bundles (like [Live + Evolution UC 33/e controller](http://www.ableton.com/pages/bundles/evolution_uc_33e) or [Live + Axiom 49](http://www.ableton.com/pages/bundles/m_audio_axiom_49))
