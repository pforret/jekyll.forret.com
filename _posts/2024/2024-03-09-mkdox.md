If I wouldn't be able to control myself, I would create a new website every week. Creating a website about ... any topic really, helps me structure the knowledge I have or am in the process of collecting about it. The tools to create a new website have changed through the years. There was my Blogger period, my WordPress period, my [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) period. And now I am in my [Mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) period.

Not the vanilla mkdocs, mind you. I am using the [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) theme. It's a beautiful theme, with a lot of plugins and features, and it's very easy to use. It felt like an upgrade from Jekyll: auto-reload upon edit, very fast and it just works. The times I've struggled to get '`jekyll serve`' or '`bundle exec jekyll serve`' running ...

The process of setting up a new Mkdocs project was still too slow and cumbersome. So I decided to make a bash script to make things easier and faster.

## 1. create new [bashew](/tag/bashew/) script

I start by creating a new script with `bashew script`. To make things very portable (I don't want to worry about which version of Python is installed on my system), I started looking into using a Docker-based approach. Luckily there was already a basic Docker image for Mkdocs available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/squidfunk/mkdocs-material). I used this as a basis and I [added more default plugins and settings](https://github.com/pforret/mkdox-material) to it.

This means I require Docker to be installed and running on my system. I added a check for this at the start of my script:

```bash
docker -v &>/dev/null || IO:die "Docker is not installed or not yet started"
docker ps &>/dev/null || IO:die "Docker is not yet started"
```

I added some plugins to the Docker image with

    pip install --no-cache-dir \
      weasyprint \
      mkdocs-material[recommended] \
      mkdocs-material[imaging] \
      mkdocs-awesome-pages-plugin \
      mkdocs-with-pdf \
      markdown-include ;

## 2. add basic commands

### `mkdox new`

* Purpose: create a new website with all the plugins and settings I need
* The actual creation of the mkdocs site is done by the mkdocs Docker image. I created a template website I always copy, with a `mkdocs.yml` file that contains all the settings I need for a new website. This is copied automatically to the new project folder. Setup of a new site: less than 2 seconds.

```bash
⏳  Create new Mkdocs Material project in example
Run 'mkdocs new' via Docker
INFO    -  Writing config file: example/mkdocs.yml
INFO    -  Writing initial docs: example/docs/index.md
Create mkdocs.yml ...
Create docs/about/extensions.md ...
Create docs/about/index.post ...
Create docs/about/plugins.md ...
Create docs/about/index.pre ...
Create docs/news/posts/2024-02-post2.md ...
Create docs/news/posts/2024-01-post1.md ...
Create docs/news/index.md ...
Create docs/index.md ...
Create .gitignore ...
✅  New Mkdocs Material project created in 'example'
# took 2s to create
```


### `mkdox serve`

* so now you just go into that folder that you just created above and run `mkdox serve` and you have a local server running with auto-reload. This also automatically starts your browser with the right URL.

```bash
WARNING -  Config value 'dev_addr': The use of the IP address '0.0.0.0' suggests a production environment or the use of a proxy to connect to the MkDocs server. However, the MkDocs' server is intended for local development purposes only. Please use a third party production-ready server instead.
INFO    -  Building documentation...
WARNING -  without generate PDF(set environment variable ENABLE_PDF_EXPORT to 1 to enable)
INFO    -  Cleaning site directory
INFO    -  Documentation built in 0.39 seconds                                             
INFO    -  [15:56:01] Watching paths for changes: 'docs', 'mkdocs.yml'

Open http://localhost:8000 in browser (macOS)
INFO    -  [15:56:08] Browser connected: http://localhost:8000/
```

This is what that looks like:

### `mkdox build`

The purpose of a website is that it becomes available online at some point. So I added a `mkdox build` command that builds the website to a `site` folder, and then checks this in. This is the folder you can then serve from your web server.

```bash
# in the beginning this was just 
mkdocs build
git add docs site
git commit -m "$MESSAGE"
git push
```
But this became a much more intelligent command later on.

## 3. add more features

### `mkdox post`

I use the [blog plugin for Mkdocs Material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/plugins/blog/), so I created a fast way to create a new blog post.

    ❯ mkdox post
    Post date (2024-03-09) >
    Post title (New post) > My new blog on waffles
    Post categories (blog,post) > news,waffles
    ✅  New post created: docs/news/posts/2024-03-09-my-new-blog-.md

### `mkdox toc` and `index.pre`/`index.post`

I often thought it would be handy to have `index.md` files that were automatically built with the links to the subpages. So I developed a system to do this.

* I can do `mkdox toc` to manually generate a table of contents for a folder
* I can do `mkdox recent` to manually generate a list of the most recent pages
* I can add `index.pre` and `index.post` files to a folder, and these will be prepended and appended to the `index.md` file, which will be generated automatically as a table-of-contents when I run `mkdox build -I`.
* this led to more development of the `mkdox build` command: create index.md files, create PDf version, create site, commit and push site.

## Configuration

So I can now start up a new website in seconds. Creating a GitHub/BitBucket repo to store it, setting up new a [Forge](https://forge.laravel.com/) website that automatically publishes after a `git push`: maybe another 5 minutes.

Then there's still the `mkdocs.yml` file that I need to adjust for each new project. That's something I do in a text editor.

    site_name: "{SITE_NAME}"
    site_description: "{SITE_NAME} by {USERNAME}"
    theme:
        name: material
        palette:
            primary: red
        font:
            text: Nunito
    copyright: "&copy; {CREATION_YEAR} {SITE_NAME} &bull; {USERNAME}"
