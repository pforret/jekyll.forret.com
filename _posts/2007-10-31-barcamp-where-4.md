I&#8217;m getting a little nervous. Barcamp Brussels is gonna happen on Nov 24th or Dec 1st and I still haven&#8217;t found a location. All my options have returned negative. The previous times I never really had a problem with that.

So I&#8217;m gonna put the question out there: who knows a nice location for [Barcamp Brussels #4](http://www.barcamp.be/blog/2007/10/15/barcamp-brussels-4/)? If possible, I would actually like it to be hosted at someone&#8217;s offices, since it&#8217;s on a Saturday anyway &#8230;

  * In Brussels (not just the center, let&#8217;s take Brussel/Halle/Vilvoorde)
  * I expect around 100 attendees 
  * we need 3-4 presentation rooms of 20-30 persons each
  * a hall or lounge with seats and coffee would be nice
  * catering on-site or otherwise a neighbourhood with restaurants at walking distance
  * available Wifi would be handy &#8211; or we can set that up ourselves
  * preferably easy to reach by public transport, or with sufficient parking
  * if the location costs more than, say, 2000€, it&#8217;s not an option.
  * I tried a lot of socio-cultural venues (KVS, BSB, DeBuren, BTCCTB &#8230;) , but the moment I mention &#8216;Internet&#8217; they say &#8216;no&#8217;. So I gave up on those.
  * none of the locations of the previous events
