The Federal Government &#8211; through [FEDICT](http://www.belgium.be/fedict) &#8211; has set up a program to sponsor a complete package of PC + software + broadband + training for a sharp price. The title of the project: [IVI or &#8220;Internet voor Iedereen&#8221;](http://www.belgium.be/eportal/application?pageid=indexPage&navId=38747&languageParameter=nl_BE) &#8211; the launch is planned for next week, April 18th.

**LITTLE OPEN-SOURCE**  
The government&#8217;s call for proposal allowed for commercial operating systems (Windows/MacOS) [as well as open-source](http://zdnet.be/news.cfm?id=53586&p=3) (Linux/Ubuntu). Unfortunately none of the certified partners will offer a non-Windows solution. Microsoft obviously did a [strong job selling it&#8217;s OS](http://news.zdnet.co.uk/0,39020330,39261437,00.htm). [Partners in the consortia](http://zdnet.be/news.cfm?id=54853) are the obvious broadband duopoly Belgacom/Telenet, with only Mobistar as a challenger, and for the hardware Fujitsu-Siemens and Packard-Bell (no Dell?). There are also 2 smaller players: [DIDI Trade (Aartselaar)](http://www.diditrade.be/) and [SHS Computer (Neuville-enCondroz)](http://www.shscomputer.be/).

**BROADBAND IN BELGIUM**  
[<img loading="lazy" src="http://static.flickr.com/45/127367272_67c603176e.jpg" width="500" height="274" alt="Broadband" />](http://www.flickr.com/photos/pforret/127367272/ "Photo Sharing")  
We&#8217;re currently number #10 worldwide in broadband penetration: 18,3 subscribers per 100 inhabitants. This promotion should allow us to maybe jump over Sweden and Canada. Iceland, here we come!
