I found some data on the first names parents gave their children in 2004 (data from [statbel.fgov.be](http://statbel.fgov.be/figures/d22a_nl.asp)). It should come as no surprise that _passe-partout_ names (used in both Dutch and French) dominate the first names hitparade. 

Here are the top 10 per province for the girls:

Popular names in Belgium in 2004? Timeless names like Emma, Marie, Julie, Chloé. And some currently-in-fashion-names: Febe, Océane, Amber. You meet a girl in 2030 whose name is Febe? &#8220;You must be something like &#8230; 25?&#8221;

I did another exercise: within the Dutch speaking (&#8216;Flemish&#8217;) provinces, what are the top names that are local to that province only?

Antwerp: Imane, Caro, Yousra, Anissa, Yasmina
:   &#8220;Caro&#8221; is a trendy name, that had its peak in 1999 and is already on the way down (check [Wegenerdm.be](http://www.wegenerdm.be/index.php?pag=34&lang=NL) for details), and &#8220;Yousra&#8221; the same. &#8220;Imane&#8221; is a common first name since 1993, &#8220;Anissa&#8221; has been popular since the mid 80s, and Yasmina even a bit longer. (_Remark: the numbers for Brussels are NOT included in this last calculation, otherwise I&#8217;m sure there would have been Yasminas in Brussels, and as such it would not be a name local to only Antwerp_)

Limburg: Dilara, Anne, Beyza, Elisabeth, Ilayda
:   &#8220;Dilara&#8221; and &#8220;Beyza&#8221; are a favourite amongst Morrocon parents since 1995, but &#8220;Ilayda&#8221; is a very recent fad (since 2000). &#8220;Anne&#8221; is a classic Dutch name (peak around &#8217;50-&#8217;70). Elizabeth is a real timeless name: has never been wildly popular, but has never disappeared either.

Oostvlaanderen: Iris, Phebe, Ashley, Saar, Tiany
:   Phebe looks like a variant of the #10 of that province &#8220;Febe&#8221;. The name &#8220;Ashley&#8221; can probably be credited to some Australian soap opera, and Tiany makes me thinks of [the Pfaffs](http://blog.forret.com/2006/03/big-brother-and-the-pfaffs-the-end-of-reality-tv-please/). &#8220;Iris&#8221; has not been out of fashion since &#8217;70, and &#8220;Saar&#8221; is younger: started in &#8217;80.

Vlaams Brabant: Clara, Inès, Léa, Zoé, Rune
:   What&#8217;s with the accents already? A clear influence of French-speaking inhabitants here. Rune is the only Flemish name (of Celtic origin?), and was quasi non-existent five years ago.

West-Vlaanderen: Auke, Evy, Gaëlle, Hayley, Margo
:   &#8220;Auke&#8221; sounds like a name that was blown over from Holland (around 2000) and &#8220;Evy&#8221; was a fad around 1980 (with [Evy Gruyaert](http://www.evygruyaert.be/) and Evi Hansen as pretty examples). &#8220;Gaëlle&#8221; sounds so French, maybe an influence from our southern neighbors. &#8220;Hayley&#8221; &#8211; who calls their kid Hayley &#8230; &#8211; anyone has an idea where this could come from? &#8220;Margo&#8221; is the Dutch variant of &#8220;Margot&#8221;, a name that has been extremely popular since 1990.

If you plan on having kids: the raw numbers from [statbel](http://statbel.fgov.be/figures/d22a_nl.asp) are a goldmine!
