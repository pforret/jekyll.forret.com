Last year we organised a fairly successfull [blogger&#8217;s dinner](http://peter.forret.com/2005/09/19/brussels-bloggers-meeting-on-oct-7/) in Brussels, and now we&#8217;re gonna try something different:  
**next May we will have a [Barcamp Brussels](http://barcamp.org/BarCampBrusselsForTheImpatient) event.**

**WHAT IS A BARCAMP?**

</p>

Barcamp was first organised in LA by [Chris Messina and some buddies](http://barcamp.org/BarPlanners).

> [BarCamp is an ad-hoc un-conference](http://barcamp.org/) born from the desire for people to share and learn in an open environment. It is an intense event with discussions, demos, and interaction from attendees.

It is not your regular conference:

  * **No spectators, only participants**: Attendees must give a demo, a session, or help with one. All presentions are scheduled the day they happen. Prepare in advance, but come early to get a slot on the wall.
  * **No fixed agenda**: talks, demos and topics are proposed by the attendees when they arrive on a central whiteboard.

**ORGANISATION**

<p style="font-size: 0.7em; float: right; width: 240px">

</p>

The way it&#8217;s probably gonna be (lots of details still have to be filled in): everyone arrives in the morning, gets a badge and a T-shirt and add their stuff to the presentation wall. After some breakfast chatting, presentations start in 4 separate rooms. Between (and during) sessions people escape to the central space for coffee and gossip. There is a small lunch, and afterwards the presentations continue. Around 17h there is a closing session and all return happily home.

**WHO SHOULD ATTEND**

> When you come, be prepared to share with barcampers.  
> When you leave, be prepared to share it with the world.

You should be willing to learn and meet new people. The central topic is &#8220;_technology and its influence on life/society_&#8220;, so you should have at least some interest/experience in topics like: blogging, group dynamics, CMS, Webdesign, digital photography, &#8216;long tail&#8217;, blogger&#8217;s psychology, Bubble 2.0, guerilla marketing, mobile, interactive TV, Web APIs, aggregation, podcasting, timeshifting, (electronic) music &#8230; (more details on [Barcamp Brussels](http://barcamp.org/BarCampBrusselsForTheImpatient))  
Just remember: No spectators, only participants!
