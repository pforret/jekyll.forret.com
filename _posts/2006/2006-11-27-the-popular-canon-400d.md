### The new Digital Rebel

It might be me, but it&#8217;s like everyone around me is buying the new Canon 400D. OK, that&#8217;s exaggerated, but I&#8217;ve spotted at least 2 people I know per week in this last month. 

At [&euro;739](http://www.fotokonijnenberg.nl/product_details.php?id_product=21741) for a 10 megapixel digital SLR, it&#8217;s a sweet deal. The &#8216;old&#8217; 350D (now [&euro;649](http://www.fotokonijnenberg.nl/product_details.php?id_product=11283)) was already a really nice camera, but the added resolution (10 MP instead of 8 MP), the [EOS Integrated Cleaning System](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P8_LNmpFSc) and certainly the larger screen will probably make this one even a bigger best-seller. Which means I will have to cope with a lot of &#8220;Yours has only 8 megapixels? Mine has 10!&#8221; For the record: [that doesn&#8217;t matter](http://pogue.blogs.nytimes.com/2006/11/21/21pogues-posts-2/)!

> We blew up a photograph to 16 x 24 inches at a professional photo lab. One print had 13-megapixel resolution; one had 8; the third had 5. Same exact photo, down-rezzed twice, all three printed at the same poster size. (&#8230;) Iâ€™m telling you, there was NO DIFFERENCE.

Flickr already indicates [182 members](http://www.flickr.com/cameras/canon/?s=users#models) with a 400D. That&#8217;s far from the 2000+ of the 350D, but not bad for a camera that&#8217;s only a couple of months old.  
On a related note: the [camera trends graphs](http://www.flickr.com/cameras/) on Flickr have a rare default: while most graphs use &#8216;too much ink&#8217; (gridlines, legends, borders, &#8230; &#8211; check the [Tufte books](http://www.flickr.com/photos/pforret/146967628/) for more info), the Flickr charts actually lack info: no units on the X-axis (weeks? months?) nor Y-axis (10% of users? 1% of users?).
