[Ryan and Jen](http://www.hawaiiup.com/) have just announced that [they are putting an end](http://www.hawaiiup.com/lost/2006/01/30/trans-2006-01-31-aloha/) to their popular [Lost](http://abc.go.com/primetime/lost/) fan podcast, &#8220;[The Transmission](http://www.hawaiiup.com/lost/)&#8220;. Started in May 2005, the show has grown into the most popular Lost audio podcast program, featuring discussion of each episode right after it aired, feedback from listeners and &#8216;_The forward cabin_&#8216;: theories and spoilers for following episodes. A very well-produced (Ryan apparently has some radio background) show of 30 minutes each week, presented by two big fans with a good voice. I am subscribed to the podcast, and it almost feels like I know them.

I have no idea what the reason for the sudden decision is (they remain vague on the issue, so I&#8217;ll respect that), but I can imagine the show was taking over their lives to some extent. Me for one, I will miss them, I learned a lot about the Lost characters, the storylines and the Hawaii setting (Ryan and Jen are both very proud -and lucky- to be living in Hawai). It takes me more effort than the regular U.S. fan to get to see each episode when it airs (because I can't [buy them on iTunes](/2005/10/lost-in-itunes-good-and-bad-news)) so I often heard the podcast before I saw the actual episode, but I still enjoyed both of them.

Ryan and Jen, thanks for your dedication and efforts. Whatever you're up to in the future, I wish you all the luck.
