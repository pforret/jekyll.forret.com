Two geek girls &#8216;in the know&#8217; have just published their &#8220;**top 10 reasons to date a geek**&#8220;, which can also be read as: 10 indicators to check if you&#8217;re a real geek.

First one is Maryam, Robert Scoble&#8217;s wife. I met her briefly when the [Scobleizer visited Brussels in December](http://blog.coolz0r.com/posted/celebrity-geek-dinner.html), but I had no chance to talk to her since I had to leave early, and she was totally absorbed by [Coolz0r](http://blog.coolz0r.com). She struck me as a much warmer and kinder person than the &#8216;materialistic&#8217; list below would suggest.

> 1) He can fix your computer  
> 2) He has friends who can fix your computer  
> 3) He can hook up the TV, connect the DVD player and Tivo your favorite programs  
> 4) He has friends who can hook up the TV, connect the DVD player &#8230;  
> 5) He can fix your friends&#8217; computers  
> 6) He&#8217;ll make you shine every where you go (basically because he has no sense of style)  
> 7) Your geek will give you the hottest techie gadgets  
> 8) Your geek will worship the ground you walk on  
> 9) He won&#8217;t cheat on you either  
> 10) Did I mention he can fix your computer ???

Let&#8217;s say I score a 8/10 on this one.
