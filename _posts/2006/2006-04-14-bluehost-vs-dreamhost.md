As you might have read in my [Migrating to WordPress](http://blog.forret.com/2006/03/migration-to-wordpress-me-vs-murphy/) article, I am now the proud owner of both a Bluehost and Dreamhost account. These two shared hosting providers have similar strong offerings for a similar low price, but they&#8217;re nevertheless different. Let&#8217;s compare both:

**The raw numbers**

**[BLUEHOST](http://www.bluehost.com/track/pforret/COMPARE) GUI**  
Bluehost has a nice management interface: [Cpanel Pro](http://www.cpanel.net).

Their list of one-click application installs is impressive:

**[DREAMHOST](http://www.dreamhost.com/r.cgi?166410) GUI**  
The management interface of Dreamhost is an own-developed web application:

The list of one-click installs is more limited but has most best-of-breed applications:

**DNS MANAGEMENT**  
A big difference between the two is the way they handle DNS management. 

  * Bluehost will expect their DNS servers to be responsible for any domain hosted. Their management web interface will not accept to host a domain that is not controlled by their DNS servers. Believe me, I&#8217;ve tried. 
  * Bluehost does not allow you to just define subdomains in DNS and point them to some external IP address. All your subdomains must be hosted on the same Bluehost server
  * Bluehost does not allow you to choose the subfolder for a subdomain: blog.example.com is hosted on `/blog`. Unfortunately any other domain example.2.com that you have will not be able to get a subdomain blog.example2.com on another subfolder. 

**CONCLUSION**  
If your demands are not too high (not something like 10 domains with 150 subdomains), you like a complete and easy web interface and the luxury of being able to install 30+ applications with one click (it&#8217;s three actually, but who&#8217;s complaining), then take [Bluehost](http://www.bluehost.com/track/pforret/COMPARE), they&#8217;re the cheapest.  
If you need flexible DNS management, are not afraid of installing programs yourself (FTP and such), need a lot of email, database or bandwidth: [Dreamhost](http://www.dreamhost.com/r.cgi?166410) is the way to go!
