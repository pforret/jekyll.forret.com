Google has filed and published the following patent applications:

> (1) Method and system to provide wireless access at a reduced rate:  
> Methods and system for providing wireless access at a reduced rate. In one embodiment, access to a WAP is provided to an end-user at a rate subsidized by a first entity. The first entity includes advertisements in an end-user view.  
> _which sounds like a Google (secure) proxy that modifies passing-though HTML_
> 
> (2) Method and system to provide advertisements based on wireless access points:  
> Methods and system to provide advertisements in a view of an end user accessing a wireless access point. The advertisements are related to the WAP based on a predetermined criterion.  
> _aka [contextual advertising for Wifi](http://blog.forret.com/2005/11/adsense-in-all-media-tv-cinema-sport-traffic/)_
> 
> (3) Method and system for dynamically modifying the appearance of browser screens on a client device:  
> In one embodiment, a connection of a client device to a wireless access point is identified. Further, the appearance of a screen presented on the client device is modified to reflect the brand associated with a provider of the wireless access point.

What troubles me here is the way patents are being used: 

  * &#8220;don&#8217;t be evil&#8221; version: Google is just filing some good and/or obvious ideas, just so that the next guy won&#8217;t do it and sue them for using their own idea.
  * &#8220;be blatantly evil&#8221; version: Google is filing the patents to make sure no one can do the same thing, to block the market with broad, mediocre patents

Patents are there to create a window of opportunity to develop an original and innovative idea, not to be misused by [patent trolls](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent_troll). 

I don&#8217;t like patents in software (although I&#8217;m [co-author for one application](http://appft1.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&r=1&f=G&l=50&co1=AND&d=PG01&s1=forret&OS=forret&RS=forret) &#8211; everyone has the right to change his opinion). It&#8217;s silly to have 20-year patents in a world moving that fast, and the US Patent and Trademark office does not have the best track record at deciding [what is](http://www.brookings.edu/views/op-ed/20050728klemens.htm) [original](http://lawgeek.typepad.com/lawgeek/silly_patents_trix_are_for_kids/index.html) or [worth](http://www.patentlysilly.com/patent.php?patID=6830455) [giving](http://cse.stanford.edu/class/cs201/projects-99-00/software-patents/amazon.html) [a patent](http://www.wired.com/news/politics/0,1283,19473,00.html) to.
