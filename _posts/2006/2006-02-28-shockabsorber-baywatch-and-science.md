[Joey](http://www.tv.com/matt-leblanc/person/899/summary.html) from &#8220;[Friends](http://www.tv.com/friends/show/71/summary.html)&#8220;, as we all know, is very interested in bio-mechanics, certainly the topic of female movement on beaches:

> JOEY: Baywatch.  
> CHANDLER: What&#8217;s it about?  
> JOEY: Lifeguards.  
> CHANDLER: Well, it sounds kinda stupid&#8230; Who&#8217;s she?  
> JOEY: [Nicole Eggert](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001176/). You&#8217;ll like her.  
> CHANDLER: Wow! Look at them run.  
> JOEY: They do that a lot.

[<img  width="240" height="122" alt="ShockAbsorber - sports bra simulator" src="http://static.flickr.com/51/105504984_937a799808_m.jpg" />](http://www.flickr.com/photos/pforret/105504984/ "Photo Sharing")The UK bra brand [ShockAbsorber](http://www.shockabsorber.co.uk) took it one step further and actually teamed up with [Portsmouth University](http://www.port.ac.uk/) to explore the exact dynamics of chest movement during sports activity. Whoever said science was dull?

> **Teaming up with Portsmouth University**  
> In 2004, we joined forces with Portsmouth University to update and expand our original research into breast movement during exercise. Established in 1992, the [Sports Science Department](http://www.port.ac.uk/departments/academic/sportscience/) has an impressive track record of research.  
> (&#8230;)  
> **The results**  
> Analysing the movement of a C cup, it was found that wearing no bra resulted in a 3D bounce of up to 6.7cm, compared to 6.4cm for a normal bra and 3.4cm when wearing a Shock Absorber.  
> Conclusion: Shock Absorber reduces 3D bounce by up to 74% (A cup; B989 style)  
> (from [shockabsorber.co.uk](http://www.shockabsorber.co.uk/uk/index.asp?page=20))

They used the results to create the [Bounce-o-meter](http://www.shockabsorber.co.uk/bounceometer/shock.html): simulate breast movement for any cup size with and without sports bra. Joey would have loved it. One thing you notice when playing with the parameters: horseriding with a C-cup is a bad idea without the proper support. We live to learn.
