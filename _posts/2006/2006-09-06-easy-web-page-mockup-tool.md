I&#8217;ve just finished a [tool to make web page mockups](http://web.forret.com/tools/designer.asp). The purpose: make a quick draft of what a web page should look like, so you can include a screen shot in an email or a specifications document. When a client describes what page layout he wants in pure text, it is easy to misunderstand what he means. E.g. &#8220;_two levels of menu should be visible on each page_&#8220;. _Ok, you want those as a bullet list in the side bar or a breadcrumb on top?_ It&#8217;s easier to just show him an overview of: _that block goes there, that&#8217;s what I mean with two sidebars on the right, the tags are here at the right, under the recent comments._

My [web page designer](http://web.forret.com/tools/designer.asp) will let you specify headers, footers, sidebars and let you add bogus content with an easy markup syntax. [text becomes a block of text, *text becomes a bullet, _text is a link &#8230; The goal is that anyone, without any knowledge of HTML, can make a rudimentary page layout and say: see that&#8217;s what I want. I also generate &#8216;pretty&#8217; URLs in the RubyOnRails syntax (list/edit/new/&#8230;). 

It&#8217;s helped me, it might help you! Any remarks are welcome!
