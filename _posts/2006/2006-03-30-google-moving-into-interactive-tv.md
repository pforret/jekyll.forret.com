Google is looking for a &#8220;Product Manager &#8211; Interactive TV&#8221;:

Will they provide a Tivo-like service, but free and with contextual advertising? Will they [rent air-time inside regular TV programs](http://blog.forret.com/2005/11/adsense-in-all-media-tv-cinema-sport-traffic/) and put ads in there? Will they provide collaborative filtering like &#8220;_You watch &#8216;Sex In The City&#8217; all the time, how about &#8216;Bridget Jones&#8217; and some chocolate?_&#8220;? Will they store the world&#8217;s TV content and sell it pay-per-view? Will they create a TV series &#8220;Don&#8217;t be evil&#8221; about [two geeks that hang out with hot girls](http://www.valleywag.com/tech/marissa-mayer/mari-and-larrys-new-loves-152634.php) all the time? 

Interesting times ahead!
