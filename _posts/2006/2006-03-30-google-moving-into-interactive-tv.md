Will they provide a Tivo-like service, but free and with contextual advertising? Will they [rent air-time inside regular TV programs](/2005/11/adsense-in-all-media-tv-cinema-sport-traffic/) and put ads in there? Will they provide collaborative filtering like &#8220;_You watch &#8216;Sex In The City' all the time, how about &#8216;Bridget Jones' and some chocolate?_&#8220;? Will they store the world's TV content and sell it pay-per-view? Will they create a TV series &#8220;Don't be evil&#8221; about [two geeks that hang out with hot girls](http://www.valleywag.com/tech/marissa-mayer/mari-and-larrys-new-loves-152634.php) all the time? 

Interesting times ahead!
