> Last week, CNET&#8217;s Elinor Mills reported on how a web search for &#8220;[Martin Luther King](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther_King%2C_Jr.)&#8221; returns, as its first result on Google and as its second result on Windows Live Search, a web site (martinlutherking dot org) operated by a white supremacist organization named Stormfront.

How were they (i.e. Stormfront) able to reach #1 with only 372 backlinks and a Pagerank 6? Any SEO tricks being used there?

Anyway, the best thing we can do is to push Google and the other search engines in the right direction: link Martin Luther King&#8217;s name to another site that is a better start point to learn about the man. Let&#8217;s take his Wikipedia page. 

If you want to have an idea about who MLK was: check the following page:

Feel free to add your push, let&#8217;s see how long it takes before the Google results have been corrected.
