Russell Jones, CTO of SEO firm Virante, has found an original way of showing off his SEO skills: he created a top 5 of SEO excuses, and made sure they listed #1 to #5 for the Google query &#8220;[five seo excuses](http://www.google.com/search?q=five+seo+excuses)&#8220;.

> So, here it goes, my top 5 reasons that you should avoid SEO. Or, if you want to do it the long way, just search google for “five SEO excuses”, without the quotes!  
> from [thegooglecache.com](http://www.thegooglecache.com/?p=40) via [netlash.com](http://www.netlash.com/log/zoekmachine_optimalisatie_werkt)

The top **five SEO excuses** are:

  * There&#8217;s no money in it
  * It&#8217;s too competitive
  * It&#8217;s unethical, right
  * It&#8217;s too expensive
  * It just doesn&#8217;t work

Obviously, by now the top #5 has completely changed.

The #1 spot for &#8220;five SEO excuses&#8221; is now taken by [digitalpoint.com](http://forums.digitalpoint.com/showthread.php?t=129323), a very popular forum for SEO experts. The second is taken by [seroundtable.com](http://www.seroundtable.com/archives/005961.html), an SEO blog. Only on the third spot, one of the ajaxle.com domains has kept its ground. Once the big guys start playing along &#8230;

UPDATE: I became #1 Google result with this post. I apparently should be careful about what I say here.
