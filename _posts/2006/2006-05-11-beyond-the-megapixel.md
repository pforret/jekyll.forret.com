Wired just released an [article on digital camera technology](http://www.wired.com/news/technology/0,70853-0.html): why megapixels alone are not a good indicator of camera and photograph quality.

> For years, resolution was considered the main measure of image quality in digital photos, but continual improvements have only shown up the fallacy: [Grainy](http://www.dpreview.com/learn/?/key=noise), blurry and underexposed photos look just as bad at 8 megapixels as they do at 5.

Camera vendors are concentrating on other fields to enhance camera quality:

Low-light shooting
:   While camera&#8217;s used to be limited to a [sensitivity](http://www.dpreview.com/learn/?/key=sensitivity) of 400 ISO (i.e. almost worthless in night situations), new image processing algorithms and larger sensors allow newer models to go up to [3200 ISO](http://www.dpreview.com/news/0602/06021403fujif30.asp)

Flash
:   [Soft-flash](http://world.casio.com/asia/news/2006/ex_z850.html) (Casio) and [i-Flash](http://www.steves-digicams.com/pr/fuji_02142006_f30_pr.html) (Fujifilm) are ways to use a flash without ruining the natural lighting completely.

Zooming further in, or out
:   By using a right-angle construction within the body of the camera, the Panasonic Lumix DMC-TZ1K can get to a 10X optical zoom (35 mm to 350 mm). Kodak uses two 5X zoom lenses to get the same zoom capability

Keeping steady
:   [Image-stabilization](http://www.dpreview.com/learn/?/Glossary/Optical/Image_Stabilization_01.htm) technologies, both optical and [gyroscopic](http://www.canon.com/camera-museum/camera/lens/ef/data/ef_75%7E300_4%7E56is_usm.html), avoid blurry photo&#8217;s.

Capturing bright and dark
:   enhancing the [dynamic range](http://www.dpreview.com/learn/?/Glossary/Digital_Imaging/Dynamic_Range_01.htm) of the sensors by using e.g. variable pixel size

Protecting shooters from themselves
:   Find the face in the picture and focus on it, or advise the photographer on how to improve his pictures.

And I would add to that: networking. Kodak, Canon and Nikon already have cameras with built-in Wifi, and for the &#8216;old&#8217; ones that don&#8217;t have it, [Eye-Fi](http://www.eye.fi/) might have a solution (via [Scoble](http://scobleizer.wordpress.com/2006/04/26/more-on-eye-fi/)).
