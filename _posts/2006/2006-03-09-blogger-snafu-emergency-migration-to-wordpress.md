One of the reasons why I have been posting less the last couple of days, is because I was working on a migration from Blogger to WordPress. I was still working out some DNS stuff (don&#8217;t let me get into that, it&#8217;s complicated stuff , to do with how [Bluehost](http://www.bluehost.com)&#8216;s -my hosting provider- DNS management works).

So I was just writing a piece on how Google bought Writely with my [w.bloggar](http://wbloggar.com/) local client, and when I publish I get an error: &#8220;_Post was saved as draft, please log in to_ [_http://www.blogger.com/_](http://www.blogger.com/) _to publish it_&#8220;. Weird, never have that normally. Anyway, I log in, get the Blogger CAPTCHA &#8216;word verification&#8217; box and I publish. But I see no changes on [blog.forret.com](http://blog.forret.com/). I publish again. Nothing. Then I click the &#8216;View Blog&#8217; tab in my Blogger interface. This is what I see:

Apparently:

  * my blog is now published to some new awkward blogspot location.
  * my template is gone
  * the new template advises me to discover [wordpress.org](http://wordpress.org/)

<!--more-->

  
Somewhat startled I dive into my Blogger interface again and the damage is as follows:

  * my blog has been marked as a spam blog &#8211; YOU %**@!?! (after all [I&#8217;ve written on spam](http://peter.forret.com/categories/spam/), I&#8217;m not too happy with that)
  * I need to do _word verification_ for each post I do
  * my FTP publishing settings are gone and replaced by the meaningless blogspot location
  * my template is gone and replaced by the &#8220;Discover WordPress&#8221; placeholder

Instead of putting effort into restoring my Blogger set-up, I&#8217;ve decided to switch as of now to my new WordPress set-up. Unfortunately this means I have to change my URL to [peter.forret.com](http://peter.forret.com/) . This totally sucks, I know. The blog.forret.com URLs should be redirected to their new locations, and I might switch back to the old URL once I figure it all out. For now, here I am, bigger, better and quite pissed at Google/Blogger.
