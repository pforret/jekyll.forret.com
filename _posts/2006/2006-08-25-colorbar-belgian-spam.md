The first one didn&#8217;t trigger my suspicion, since I am subscribed to some music-related mailing lists. The two next mails came for 2 @forret.com aliases of which I am certain they never subscribed to any list. So I took a closer look at the email. No contact details are given, no indication of where the email addresses came from, no possibility to unsubscribe, i.e. it&#8217;s a spam mail. To be even more specific: a belgian spam message.

[Colorbar](http://www.colorbar.be) seems to be &#8220;a gay friendly concept @ Red&Blue&#8221;. Whatever. I&#8217;m quite sure I never subscribed to Colorbar&#8217;s nor Red&Blue&#8217;s mailinglist with any of those three addresses. So, mr. Smits, where did you get my email addresses? And if you insist on doing email marketing, could you at least be professional and put a link to the [Colorbar unsubscribe page](http://www.colorbar.be/lists/?p=unsubscribe&id=2) in every mail you send?
