Henny Heyndrickx, the boss of [Tabaknatie](http://www.tabaknatie.be), is very worried about the ruthless discrimination of smokers in Belgium. With the ban on smoking in restaurants coming into effect in less than 60 days, he wants to set up a list of &#8216;smoker-friendly&#8217; restaurants. This means: restaurants that have a smoking room _(* see below)_ installed.

His quote (translated by me):

> &#8220;Often it is important for our business partners to enjoy a cigarette _at the table in between courses_. (&#8230;) We guarantee restaurants that can still allow smoking thanks to extra measures, a mentioning on our website, and also that we will take advantage of every occasion to promote these &#8216;smoke-friendly&#8217; restaurants amongst our customers and relations.&#8221;

> I can live with the limited space (of a smoking room), but this is really a boycot of the cigarette. What else? Belgium is a leader in the battle against smoking, together with some other countries. Apparently everything should be banned here. After tobacco we might get a ban on whiskey.&#8221;

Some remarks on that:

  * if whiskey would kill as many people per year and be as annoying for bystanders as smoking, then they should ban it. But it doesn&#8217;t and it isn&#8217;t. That statement is demagogic.
  * Belgium is not that avant-garde in keeping restaurants smokefree. [Argentina](http://tangospam.typepad.com/tangospam_la_vida_con_deb/2006/10/buenos_airesair.html), Australia, California, Canada, [D.C.](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/01/04/AR2006010401310.html), Ireland, Malta, Malaysia, New Zealand, Norway, Spain, Sweden &#8230; already implemented it, and the UK will follow in 2007. ([wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_smoking_bans)). I hope he does realize how cynical that statement is: &#8220;do we really have to move so fast with all this health concern and saving lives and shit?&#8221;
  * If Mr. Heyndrickx cares about health, it&#8217;s probably primarily the financial health of his company. It is the biggest organisation in transport and warehousing of cigarettes (37 mio euro turnover and 200 employees &#8211; they store the [equivalent of 3 packs of cigarettes](http://www.vilt.be/nieuwsarchief/detail.phtml?id=8500) for each person on Earth). Since the beginning of 2006, he is the [sole owner of the company](http://www.express.be/zint/dvp_articles.ArticleDetail?ArtikelIdA=25683) and he wishes to leave it to both his children. Heartwarming. I hope they both smoke like chimneys and make daddy proud.
  * At the end of the day, smoking is a historic error. No consumption article with such devastating effect on health and society would stand a chance of of getting approved these days. It&#8217;s just been around long enough to create a big industry with deep pockets and strong enough lobbying power to avoid getting treated as the social cancer that they really are. On that topic: go see &#8220;Thank you for smoking&#8221;. It is hilarious.

I look down this table, all I see are white flags. Our numbers are down all across the board. Teen smoking, our bread and butter, is falling like a shit from heaven! We don&#8217;t sell Tic Tacs for Christ&#8217;s sake. We sell cigarettes. And they&#8217;re cool and available and \*addictive\*. The job is almost done for us!

<small><strong>* Smoking room</strong>: A <a href="https://portal.health.fgov.be/pls/portal/internet.glossary_display.show?p_term_id=1864&#038;p_lang=en">smoking room</a> is an area where smoking is allowed. It must be clearly indicated and closed off from the rest of the establishment. (&#8230;) It can not be a transit zone (to toilets, garden). It can not be larger than 25% of the total area. Only drinks can be served in that area. There must be a smoke evacuation system installed.</small>
