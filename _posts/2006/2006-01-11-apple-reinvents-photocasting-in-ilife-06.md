&#8220;Eigen lof stinkt&#8221; as they say in Dutch, but who told you back in August of 2005 that [RSS + images made sense (_&#8216;Photofeed: image podcasting&#8217;_)](http://blog.forret.com/blog/2005/08/photofeed-image-podcasting.html)?

> A major new feature of iLife ‘06 is what Apple calls “Photocasting.” Described as podcasting for photos, photocasting makes it possible to share photos over the Internet using one mouse-click. The photos are updated to your .Mac account, where users can subscribe to them using Really Simple Syndication (RSS).

and

> Take Photocasting, for instance. A brand-new feature in iPhoto 6, it lets you share full-resolution photos with friends and family who subscribe via an email invitation you send using your .Mac Mail account. As you update photos in a Photocast album, they appear in your subscribers’ iPhoto libraries automatically — ready to print or add to iPhoto books, calendars, or greeting cards. And anyone can subscribe to your Photocasts: even if they don&#8217;t have iPhoto, they can still access your photos _via any RSS-compatible web browser_.

Photocasting, photofeed, tom-ay-to, tom-ah-to, whatever. It&#8217;s great to be right! Just send that MacBook Pro my way, Steve.

I don&#8217;t know how the implementation works yet (but I hope it works out of the box with [Flickr](http://www.smoothouse.com/blog/2005/08/flickr-photofeeds/), [Pixagogo](http://www.smoothouse.com/blog/2005/08/pixagogo-photofeeds/) and [SmugMug](http://www.smoothouse.com/blog/2005/09/smugmug-photofeeds/) photofeeds).
