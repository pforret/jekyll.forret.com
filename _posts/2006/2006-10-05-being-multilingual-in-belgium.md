Who doesn&#8217;t like a good controversy? The [Belgian government statistics site](http://www.statbel.fgov.be) has just released a [study on language knowledge in Belgium](http://www.statbel.fgov.be/studies/thesis_nl.asp?n=594). This study has numbers for Brussels, Flanders and Wallonia separately. Let&#8217;s take a look:

**SOURCE STATS**

Can be found via the statbel page cited above: knowledge of 1, 2 or 3 languages, in the age groups <= 40 and > 40. The numbers are a bit weird (e.g. the number of people that speak NL+FR includes those who speak NL+FR+EN, so the numbers add up to something way bigger than 100%), but I recalculated them in order to make sense and be easily chartable.

### The charts

**Belgium: overall stats**

I actually got these numbers by taking a weighted average of the separate numbers for Brussels (1 mio inhabitants), Flanders (6 mio) and Wallonia (3,3 mio). It is not 100% accurate (the population distribution below and above age 40 might be different) but gives a good approximation.

Most remarkable here: the generation gap. Multi-linguism has gone way up in the age group < 40 years, mostly thanks to more mastering of English. The occurrence of people speaking 3 languages has doubled!

**Brussels**

Wow, what is this? 7% of people in Brussels only speak Dutch (NL)? They must be having a hard time getting anything done, like, shopping or asking for directions. The rise in FR-EN might be due to the inflow of English speaking eurocrats that learn French as a second language. That rise also seems to be the reason why tri-linguism has dropped. I think the &#8220;FR&#8221; colums also includes people that speak Polish and French, or Arab and French. 

**Flanders**

[<img border="0" src="http://static.flickr.com/107/261322897_a08f4b3d68.jpg" />](http://flickr.com/photos/37855527@N00/261322897 "Language knowledge in Vlaanderen")

That&#8217;s the Flemish education system for you! 12% of young people speak only 1 language, and almost 60% speak 3 languages. The FR-EN column might be the eurocrats again, living between Brussels and Leuven.

**Wallonia**

[<img border="0" src="http://static.flickr.com/101/261322898_25b7f92cba.jpg" />](http://flickr.com/photos/37855527@N00/261322898 "Language knowledge in Wallonie")

It&#8217;s the inverse of Flanders: half of the people only speak French, and only 10% speaks 3 langauges. If they can be bothered to learn a second language, it&#8217;s mostly not Dutch. Why learn Dutch? We would only need it to find a job in Brussels&#8230; 

In 2005 we had a French-speaking senator who [signed a contract with Bernie Ecclestone](http://www.motorsport-network.com/index/publish/article_150.shtml) (Formula 1) without reading it since he did not understand the English. And more recently the [French-speaking press publishers sued Google](http://blog.searchenginewatch.com/blog/060920-152314) for something which only proved that they did not understand how search engines work. Luckily for them the judge did not either, and they won. 

They&#8217;re gonna need more than that [Marshall plan](http://www.wallonie.be/fr/news/detail/le_plan_marshall_a_un_an_bilan.shtml?detail=1d2401930da20888010da21dad420046).
