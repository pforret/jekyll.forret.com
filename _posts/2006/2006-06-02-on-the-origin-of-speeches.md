If you were wondering why I posted so little this week: I was collecting presentations, sorting through pictures ([Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/barcampbrussels/) and [Lifeblogger](http://lifeblogger.typepad.com/barcamp/2006/05/history_and_fut.html)) and movies ([Google video](http://www.blogologie.be/2006/05/accessibility_d.html) and [Dailymotion](http://www.dailymotion.com/pforret/barcampbrussels)) and posting the reviews of the [Barcamp](http://barcamp.forret.com) topics. The collection is still not complete (let&#8217;s say that I&#8217;m at 70%), but I&#8217;m still waiting on [feedback from some](http://barcamp.forret.com/blog/2006/06/02/overview-of-speeches/) of the speakers/podcasters.

Here they are:  
[**Barcamp Brussels speeches**](http://barcamp.forret.com/blog/speeches/)

I have video footage for a dozen presentations (thx to [Maarten](http://www.blogologie.be)!), Powerpoint or PDF presentations for over 50%, and in the worst case only some pictures. At least there is proof that the speaker was really there. I&#8217;m still waiting for video&#8217;s from Bert ([Netlash](http://www.netlash.com/log/conversie-architectuur_for_the_impatient)) and audio interviews from [Alice](http://www.smetty.be/2006/05/21/barcamp-alice-en-irene) and [Irene](http://www.mixette.com/blog/?p=39).

And then: start preparing the next Barcamp Brussels!
