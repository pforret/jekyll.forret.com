It&#8217;s been a while since I was really pleasantly surprised by a new Belgian group ([Moiano comes to mind](http://blog.forret.com/blog/2004/08/moiano-teaches-soulschool.html)) but it just happened again. I was humming along to the little pearl &#8220;Troubles and Fights&#8221; by [Lalalover](http://www.lalalover.com) &#8211; _&#8220;Wow, who&#8217;s that?&#8221;_ &#8211; and then I find out it&#8217;s a Belgian group started by Tom Kestens &#8211; former multi-instrumentalist with [das pop](http://www.daspop.be/).

Check out the song performed live on &#8220;[De Laatste Show](http://www.delaatsteshow.be)&#8221; &#8211; the supporting singer is Belgium&#8217;s best soul voice [Stef Caers](http://www.guido.be/desktopmodules/articledetail.aspx?mid=414&itemid=1507&tabid=68&pageid=0), of [Moiano](http://www.moiano.com/) and [Krewcial](http://www.krewcial.com/) fame.

This is a part of the lyrics of &#8220;Troubles & Fights&#8221;:

> _(first the &#8220;toododo doo doo too &#8230;&#8221; Muppets-like riddle that innocently glues itself to your brain for days)_
> 
> What&#8217;s the secret to unlock your mind ?  
> If I knew that it would simplify our lives  
> I feel helpless &#8217;cause I&#8217;m trying to do things right  
> Don&#8217;t know if I can do better
> 
> People tell me you&#8217;re so innocent  
> And it strikes me how you play that part so well  
> I feel useless &#8217;cause I&#8217;m trying to make things right  
> But I know it doesn&#8217;t matter
> 
> &#8216;CAUSE EVERY TIME WE TRY TO OVERCOME  
> OUR TROUBLES & OUR FIGHTS IT WON&#8217;T TAKE LONG  
> BEFORE WE FALL INTO EACHOTHER&#8217;S ARMS AGAIN  
> SAYING WORDS LIKE &#8220;I WAS WRONG&#8221;  
> _(from [TROUBLES.doc](http://www.lalalover.com/lyrics/TROUBLES.doc) &#8211; they publish the lyrics in MS Word format &#8211; how adoringly clumsy is that!)_

I unfortunately missed their (sold-out) concert in the [AB Club](http://www.abconcerts.be) last week. [De Standaard](http://www.standaard.be/Artikel/Detail.aspx?artikelid=GUKONO6M) cites influences like Steely Dan and Steve Winwood, [De Morgen](http://www.lalalover.com/presspdf/deMorgenrecensie.pdf) mentions the Beatles and Crowded House. Crowded House, that sounds about right!

Their next concert in the neighbourhood of Brussels: 27 April 2006 &#8211; [Het Depot, Leuven](http://www.hetdepot.be/concerten/index.html). Support act is [Milow](http://www.milow.be/), the singer song-writer [Pietel](http://www.pietel.be/archives/1025) has been marketing to us for months. Leuven it is, then!
