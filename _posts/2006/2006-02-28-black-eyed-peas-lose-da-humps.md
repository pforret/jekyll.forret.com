> What you gonna do with all that junk?  
> All that junk inside that trunk?  
> I&#8217;ma get, get, get, get you drunk,  
> Get you love drunk off my hump.  
> What you gon&#8217; do with all that ass?  
> All that ass inside them jeans?  
> I&#8217;ma make, make, make, make you scream  
> Make you scream, make you scream.  
> What you gonna do with all that junk?  
> All that junk inside that trunk?  
> I&#8217;ma get, get, get, get you drunk,  
> Get you love drunk off this hump.  
> What you gon&#8217; do wit all that breast?  
> All that breast inside that shirt?  
> I&#8217;ma make, make, make, make you work  
> Make you work, work, make you work.

I&#8217;m all for freedom of expression and stuff, but is this the kind of conversation we want kids to find normal? We already teach them to get rich quick, because then they can have dozens of semi-naked women dancing around their pool (thank you, MTV), but now a boy-girl conversation starts with &#8220;_What are you going to do with all that breast inside your shirt?_&#8221; And the girl is supposed to be amused or flattered?  
I rather liked the [Black Eyed Peas](http://www.blackeyedpeas.com/), actually. They made some clever music, with excellent recycling/sampling, and they had a strong woman singer. These are some quotes of them talking about their latest album:

> &#8220;When you&#8217;re on bad terms with a significant other, you don&#8217;t want to break up. You tell her things and at the time you really mean them. But she&#8217;s saying, stop f\****ing with me.&#8221;  
> &#8220;It&#8217;s a song about owning up and apologizing and realizing your faults. It&#8217;s about being a man or a woman – an adult – and confronting situations honestly&#8221;

All that grown-up stuff, and then you have [Fergie showing off her bottom](http://www.blackeyedpeas.com/home/videos/106003) to strike a balance? Whatever. I don&#8217;t like the song (the synthesizer F-G-G# thing annoys me) and I certainly hate the lyrics. God, I&#8217;m getting old.
