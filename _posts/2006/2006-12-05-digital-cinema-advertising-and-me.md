Those of you who have been reading this blog for a while, might have seen some posts on &#8220;[digital cinema](http://blog.forret.com/tag/digitalcinema/)&#8220;. I have been researching the topic for more than a year now. And for a reason, of course: it seemed like the right kind of business for me, at the right moment (i.e. the really early days). And well, now I&#8217;ve actually found a way to make it into my day-time job.

I've just started working at [Screenvision Europe](http://www.screenvisioneurope.com/site/eur/eur_index.php) as Technical Director. Specifically, I will be coordinating the Belgian migration towards digital cinema advertising: that is, digital distribution and digital projection. An ambitious project with a nice mix of technology, media and cinema &#8211; and a great bunch of [colleagues](http://www.screenvision.be). (Yes, Screenvision is indeed the fireworks logo you see before the commercials in the cinema and, no, I can&#8217;t change that logo) So don&#8217;t be surprised to see acronyms like MPEG2, JPEG2000, S/PDIF, 2K and 1080i pop up in my posts and/or links from now on. 

I now have an even better excuse to see more movies (as if I needed that).
