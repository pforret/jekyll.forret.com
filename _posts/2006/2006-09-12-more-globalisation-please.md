A while back I bought the whole suite of Edward Tufte books: &#8220;[The visual display of quantitative data](http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_vdqi)&#8220;, &#8220;[Envisioning Information](http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_ei)&#8221; and &#8220;[Visual Explanations](http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_visex)&#8220;. 

Today my copy of &#8220;Beautiful evidence&#8221; arrived in the mail. Actually a Belgian Post employee came to drop it off, because I had to pay 10 euro douane/customs. For a book of $52, that is an unpleasant extra 25%.

[<img  width="500" height="286" src="http://static.flickr.com/80/241403729_7c01ff4103.jpg" alt="Beautiful Evidence: by Edward Tufte" />](http://www.flickr.com/photos/pforret/241403729/ "Photo Sharing")

The legislation that was printed on the back of the receipt states that any item from outside the EU, with a value higher than 22 euro, or not conform to &#8216;small letter mail of non-commercial kind&#8217; (up to 45 euro), or containing goods from outside the EU should be presented to customs. Standard fee: 10 euro. I have just ordered a [t-shirt from SomaFM](http://somafm.com/tshirts/) ($50), I wonder what customs will think of that.

<!--more-->

This means that there is still a big hurdle for purchasing stuff in between continents. For the Tufte book, I already payed $5 shipping fee (surface mail), and now an extra $13 in customs. So, in this case I pay more than 33% extra as a &#8216;punishment&#8217; for not living in the USA. It may be a global market for buying stuff, but not for getting stuff.

I don&#8217;t think Edward Tufte is focused on huge turnover (it&#8217;s kind of a niche topic, let&#8217;s be honest), but for US vendors that are, they should investigate ways to not punish their non-US customers that hard.

  * for a book publisher: either sell through Amazon.co.uk (or .fr, .de) or set up a deal with an EU printer/shipment firm to fulfill orders from within the EU. For Tufte books: the only one you can get on Amazon UK is [The Visual Display of Quantitative Information.](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=as2&path=ASIN/0961392142&tag=forretcom-21&camp=1634&creative=6738)<img  width="1" height="1" border="0" style="border: medium none  ! important; margin: 0px ! important;" alt="" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.co.uk/e/ir?t=forretcom-21&l=as2&o=2&a=0961392142" /> 
  * for custom t-shirts e.g. [SomaFM](http://www.somafm.com/)): instead of shipping them from the US, create a European [Spreadshirt](http://www.spreadshirt.net/shop.php?sid=40000&affiliate=322304) store. As they [correctly state](http://www.spreadshirt.net/International.427.0.html): _&#8220;Note: Yes, if you&#8217;d like to sell to both markets, **you&#8217;ll need to register two different shops!&#8221;**_
