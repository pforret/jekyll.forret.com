I had been wondering just how much information Google Adsense uses to select the right contextual ads. Specifically, do they use the referring page also. I just got part of the answer:  
[<img  width="500" src="http://static.flickr.com/41/124139014_d3777be5b2.jpg" alt="Adsense: after search on Antwerp" height="346" />](http://www.flickr.com/photos/pforret/124139014/ "Photo Sharing")

A blog post of mine on [Live Traffic Info](http://blog.forret.com/2004/12/live-traffic-info/) briefly mentions Antwerp. The Adsense ads on the page normally show geeky ads (_&#8216;blogs&#8217;, &#8216;XML&#8217;, &#8216;bandwidth&#8217;,_ &#8230; I write about technical stuff too much, mea culpa).  
The page also shows up high in Google when you search on [antwerp traffic info](http://www.google.com/search?q=antwerp+traffic+info). Now if you click through on the Google Search Result, you have a very high chance of getting &#8220;Antwerp&#8221; related ads. Which to me looks like Adsense also takes into account what page you just came from &#8211; at least if it&#8217;s a SERP (Search Engine Result Page).  
(note: it does not work for &#8220;brussels traffic info&#8221; &#8211; apparently no advertisers for Brussels)

This is a list of things Adsense can take into account:

page related
:   [page title, URL, keywords, language](http://www.google.com/adwords/learningcenter/text/18990.html)
:   site language, keywords(when Adsense has no info about the specific page)

visitor related
:   [country](http://www.google.com/adwords/learningcenter/text/19164.html) (from IP address)
:   [user language](http://www.google.com/adwords/learningcenter/text/19164.html) (from browser)

visit related
:   previous shown Adsense ads
:   referring page, search query
