Dave Hornik recently explained to his 8-year old son what his job entailed (Dave&#8217;s [a VC](http://www.augustcap.com/team/dh.shtml)) and the response was as follows:

> A couple nights ago my son came to me with a handful of papers with various designs and announced that he was ready to start his skate brand. After an exhaustive process, he had decided to name his company Ollie King &#8482;, and he was ready to go. I told him that he would have to wait because I was reading to his sister, at which point he stormed up stairs to his mother, ripped up his skate designs, threw them in the trash, and creamed to her &#8220;daddy won&#8217;t fund my company!&#8221; This did not sit well with my wife &#8212; apparently, as his father, I have an obligation to fund my son&#8217;s skate brand.

The elegant solution to the situation was actually to give the boy a domain name, a blog and set up a [Caf√© Press shop](http://www.cafepress.com) with T-shirts, baseball caps and stickers. &#8220;_User generated content is going to continue to proliferate as the eight year olds of the world create MySpace pages and blogs and skate stores. Who knows what they&#8217;ll create when they are nine_.&#8221;

The &#8220;[long tail](http://longtail.typepad.com/the_long_tail/)&#8221; has made entrepreneurship so much more accessible. Maybe not if you want to start a bank or an airline company, but to set up a small venture for a rock group, youth&#8217;s organisation: all you need are (free) tools like these:

  * set up a free blog on WordPress.com, Blogspot or .Mac 
  * host your pictures on Flickr, Pixagogo or 23hq 
  * print them on posters via Qoop 
  * host your videos on YouTube, Dailymotion or Google Video 
  * host your audio files on MySpace 
  * sell your CDs via CafePress 
  * create and sell DVD via ? 
  * create and sell ringtones via ? 
  * mashup your data with Google Maps 
  * set up a forum, wki, digg-clone fo your members/customers 
  * monetize your site with Adsense (if the traffic picks up, that is) 
  * create apparel like T-shirts and caps with CafePress or Spreadshirt 
  * if you want to make a steel/plastic prototype of an invention, [print it in 3D](http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/13.09/fablab.html)

What I see is a lot of building blocks, the only tricky thing is to glue them together. So there will be work for people like me to puzzle them together. The future&#8217;s bright.
