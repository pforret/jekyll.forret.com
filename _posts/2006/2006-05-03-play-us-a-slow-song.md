I remember when I started DJ&#8217;ing and going to parties (that would be the previous century, yes) that we used to have this whole &#8216;slow-dancing&#8217; routine. Every couple of hours the DJ would play &#8216;[La Bamba](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Bamba_%28song%29)&#8216;, sweaty teenagers would check each other out for a quick dance and a stolen kiss (on the cheek), and then there would be 3 to 5 ballads, or &#8216;slows&#8217;. Fifteen minutes of one boy slow-dancing with one girl. For those of you who have never done that: with the right kind of partner it is awesome.

I find it a pity that this tradition has disappeared. Actually, I even think it should be revived. For one, there is this huge library of amazing ballads out there (I&#8217;m not referring to Glen Medeiros) and they never get played on parties anymore. They&#8217;re used as wallpaper in some loungy bars, but never for dancing. It&#8217;s a shame. On top of that, we now have generations of young people that have no clue how to dance in a couple, how to lead, how to improvise. We&#8217;re losing a valuable part of human interaction to Red Bull and pounding techno music.

So this is my proposal: I&#8217;d like to host a &#8216;slow room&#8217; at one of the larger parties in Brussels, like the [KVS](http://www.kvs.be/)&#8216; &#8220;Bal in de Box&#8221;. One cosy room with a dance-floor and some seats with ballads all night long. You come in when you want, have a drink, listen to great ballads (I&#8217;ve got quite a collection and I wouldn&#8217;t play the obvious ones), dance a bit with someone you know or don&#8217;t, and then leave to join the house/techno/R&B rooms when you feel like it. I would probably use a &#8216;tango salon&#8217; timing: tandas (series of 5-6 songs in a similar tempo) with a cortina (song that cannot be danced to &#8211; well not in a slow sense) in between, so that a dance between two people will at most last for 20 minutes. Some people might be too shy to invite someone so they could be incentivised. &#8220;_Next 5 songs, only the ladies/people with glasses/guys with white socks invite._&#8221;

I think it&#8217;s a fun concept, and now is also a good time: Sterren op de dansvloer (VTM) and Let&#8217;s Dance (VT4) have re-introduced couple dancing as a both entertaining and appealing hobby. There&#8217;s load of stuff you could add to it: beginner&#8217;s courses (slow dancing is nowhere as complex as tango, but if it&#8217;s the first time &#8230;), a friendly competition, a hard-rock/ jazz/ schlager tanda, fancy dress, movie themes, &#8230; The only thing I need is: the opportunity. Anyone at the KVS reading this?
