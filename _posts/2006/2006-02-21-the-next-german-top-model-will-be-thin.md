The &#8216;top model&#8217; Heidi Klum presents a TV show: [**Germany&#8217;s Next Top Model**](http://www.prosieben.de/lifestyle_magazine/topmodel/index.php), basically a contest for a bunch of girls who want to become a top model (date actors, eat carrots, spend hours getting your hair done, dress lightly and get paid a whole lot of money while doing that). Recently one of the candidates was dismissed and the reasons were somewhat controversial:

> Irina&#8217;s misfortune was her height-weight ratio &#8212; she weighed 52 kilograms (114.5 pounds) and was 1.76 meters (5 feet 9 inches) tall. With that kind of body, Irina, 19, was used to being adoringly ogled, but on supermodel Heidi Klum&#8217;s television show &#8220;Germany&#8217;s Next Top-Model&#8221; her body became her downfall. &#8220;Too fat,&#8221; was the verdict handed down by the show&#8217;s jury. The svelte Irina was sent home.

The poor thing has a [BMI (Body Mass Index)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index) of 16.8, which places her [under the 5th percentile for her age](http://www.flickr.com/photos/pforret/100440614/). In theory, she could very well be an anorexic.

One wonders: do only extremely thin/skinny girls get a chance at becoming a top model? &#8220;Germany&#8217;s Next Top Model&#8221; (Prosieben) actually publishes dimensions and measurements for all girls. Which means that, if one were to throw those into a spreadsheet, one could make some graphs of that, couldn&#8217;t one? And so it happened that that was exactly what I did. Here are some results:

### BMI (BODY MASS INDEX)

[<img height="307" alt="50% anorexic" src="http://static.flickr.com/32/100448951_d4032de97b.jpg" />](http://www.flickr.com/photos/pforret/100448951/ "Photo Sharing")  
The average BMI is 17,6. Granted, there are some 16-years olds amongst them (younger girls typically have smaller BMIs &#8211; cf [BMI percentile for girls (PDF)](http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/growthcharts/set1/chart16.pdf)) but more than half would be considered a candidate for anorexia by a US nutrition specialist (see remark). The lowest BMI was Katrin (23y, 171cm, 46kg) with 15,7 and the highest Ramona (17y, 173cm, 61kg) with 20,4. Both didn&#8217;t make it to the final selection. Heidi Klum herself is also a small eater: 17,2.  
_**REMARK**: the indicator used is: below the 5th percentile in that age group. It indicates **a risk for** anorexia. Keep in mind that &#8220;anorexia nervosa => exceptionally thin&#8221; does not mean &#8220;exceptionally thin => anorexia nervosa&#8221; (classical &#8216;[non-sequitur](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non_sequitur_%28logic%29)&#8216;)). The only percentile numbers I found are for the US population, but remember that the average weight in the States ([27% overweight](http://www.flickr.com/photos/pforret/100771662/)) is significantly higher than Germany (19%) or Belgium (12% overweight). So a woman with a BMI of 18 in the US can be considered &#8216;exceptionally thin&#8217;, while the same weight/height ratio in Belgium is not that exceptional. I have several female friends with a BMI of 18 or lower, and I can assure you they do not have any eating disorder._

### CURVES

OK, bear with me for a moment. I also had the bust/waist/hips measurements. But I wanted a single number instead of 3. So I did the following: there is this 90-60-90 ideal that men seem to prefer (the &#8216;average man&#8217; presumably, my hands are too small). Think &#8220;Monica Belluci&#8221; (perfect 100%)! Now calm your breathing and read on. So I came up with a CURVE (or &#8216;_wasp_&#8216;) coefficient that scores 100% for that mythical 90-60-90 and that grows the more wasp-like the figure is (`waist/[[hip+bust]/2]` is smaller) and the more symmetric it is (`hip/bust` is 1). To get a feeling for it: the minimal score is 76% for Jennifer (80-66-91) and the maximum score is 97% for Missy (90-62-90). Heidi Klum scores an average 93% (88-61-86). There is of course a correlation between BMI and CURVE. It&#8217;s kinda hard to be a 90-60-90 and be exceptionally thin. Something&#8217;s gotta give.

### CONCLUSIONS

  * BMI: is not the defining factor for making it in a &#8220;Top Model&#8221; kind of show (in the sense of: the lower the better). What a relief! Although, a look at the chart shows that having an &#8216;unusual&#8217; BMI does not help: all candidates with a BMI below 17 or above 18 are no longer in the running.
  * CURVE: Monica Belluci would have a hard time here. The least curvy girl (76% Jennifer, mainly because of her err&#8230; less significant chest area) is still in there. All candidates with a CURVES coefficient above 93% are out.
  * QUALITY/QUANTITY: I am confident that, in order to win a contest like that, a lot of other qualities are more important than measurements (say: IQ, character, confidence, prettiness) but I limited myself here to an exercise in Excel statistics.
  * TOPIC: statistics and pretty women: I love it. Any related stuff I should dive in to? Actresses? European models compared to US models? Spanish vs German?
