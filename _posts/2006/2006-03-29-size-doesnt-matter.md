Sometimes a spam mail escapes my filters and shows up in my inbox. Last week I got a &#8220;_Enlarge your &#8230;_&#8221; mail with some girl's name in the From field. I deleted it right away but subconsciously I had already read some of the content. So I went back and retrieved it from my Deleted Items just to be sure: they really talk about &#8220;**enlarge a penis up to 10 cm**&#8220;? (_UPDATE: I read this as 10cm TOTAL length, not 10 cm EXTRA length_)  
Indeed:

First off: as a straight guy I have no practical knowledge of what average size a girl has to put up with these days. Nor am I about to disclose my own dimensions (I want women to like me for my personality). Nevertheless, 10cm or 4&#8243; strikes me as rather short, certainly as an ideal to be reached by taking pills. For those who cannot estimate dimensions: that's the height of a cheap Nokia phone (the [1100](http://www.nokia.be/uk/phones/PhoneModels/1100/index.html), say).

Just to be sure, I checked the numbers provided by Alfred Kinsey:  
[<img src="http://static.flickr.com/51/118965411_df7ce7d77d.jpg" width="500" alt="Average penis size" />](http://www.flickr.com/photos/pforret/118965411/ "Photo Sharing")  
Average size 6.17 inch or 15.6 cm (for caucasian men); virtually none below 4 inch. (For Ine, 156mm, that's the length of a [Nikon Series E Zoom 70-210mm lens](http://www.mir.com.my/rb/photography/hardwares/classics/emfgfg20/eserieslenses/htmls/70210mm.htm))

So why was the spammer using these ridiculous measurements? I have 2 theories:

  1. to make even the most miniscule endowed men feel good about themselves (_&#8220;I don't need no pills to get to 4 inch! I just have to think about Pamela Anderson! And not drink for an hour, that's the hard part.&#8221;_)
  2. an author that is either not familiar with both the metric and imperial system (is there a third?), either not familiar with the English language or just too lazy to re-read the whole message.

At the other side of the spectrum of well-hungness, I once heard the story that in WWII the CIA was planning to distribute XXL condoms in Germany that were labeled &#8220;Made in the US. Medium size.&#8221;. They never executed it, so no telling what the effect on the war would have been. Unfortunately I can't find any web page on that topic. Anyone?
