(post seems to have disappeared when I migrated to WordPress  
I have what is proving to be an expensive habit: I&#8217;m subscribed to over 30 podcasts (including e.g. <a href="http://revision3.com/diggnation" target="_blank">Diggnation</a> at 300MB/week), I regularly download software to try out, I use BitTorrent on a regular basis, I buy stuff on iTunes. All that adds up to more than my allowance my ISP subscription gives me (20GB per month). Most of the months I pay an extra &euro;8 per 10GB.

I&#8217;m a <a href="http://www.coditel.be/" target="_blank">Coditel</a> customer (cable provider in the part of Brussels where I live). I started out on ADSL until I got loads of technical problems and Belgacom/Skynet could not solve them. My current bandwidth is not bad (although not as fast as Telenet):

> <a href="http://www.adslbox.be" target="_blank">http://www.adslbox.be</a> speed test results:  
> &#8211; Download speed : 4415 kbit/s or 552 kbyte/s  
> (in theory it should be 10.000 kbit/s)  
> &#8211; Upload speed : 233 kbit/s or 29 kbyte/s  
> Wed Feb 15 2006 at 20:59:42 UTC+0100

But now I want to know: do I have the best formula? So I collected some data. On <a href="http://www.vergelijking.be/internet/breedband.php" target="_blank">vergelijking.be</a> all the provider formulas are listed, but the list is not up-to-date. I collected all the latest numbers from the ISPs&#8217; homepages. I got some real throughput statistics from <a href="http://www.adslbox.be" target="_blank">adslbox.be</a> and <a href="http://www.ispmonitor.be/" target="_blank">ispmonitor.be</a>.

### BROADBAND PRICES

[<img  src="http://static.flickr.com/31/100186776_e4ca7694bb.jpg" width="500" height="430" alt="Broadband in Belgium: sorted by price" />](http://www.flickr.com/photos/pforret/100186776/ "Photo Sharing")  
The cheapest broadband one can get is Coditel LightClick: 22,90 &euro; for 1 Mbps. The best price/speed you can get is Telenet ExpressnetTurbo (60&euro; for a theorethical 20Mbps and an actual throughput of about 11 Mbps). The one to avoid is Belgacom ADSL Light: 30 &euro; for a meager 0,5 Mbps.

### COST OF 50GB/MON

Now let&#8217;s see what happens if I would go to 50GB data transfer per month. Only 6 providers allow for this, either because their GB/mon allowance is big enough or because the price per extra GB is acceptable:

Where I live, I cannot get BruTele or Chello, so the only options are Coditel (cable) and Dommel, RealDSL or Mobistar (ADSL).

### GB/MON ALLOWANCE

[<img  src="http://static.flickr.com/30/100894746_1be89383c9.jpg" width="500" height="487" alt="Broandband in Belgium: GB/mon allowance" />](http://www.flickr.com/photos/pforret/100894746/ "Photo Sharing")  
There are a 6 broadband subscriptions that allow unlimited download allowances: Dommel Netconnect Pro, BruTele @Home and @Turbo, RealDSL Basic and GeekDSL and Chello Extreme. The only options for me in Brussels are the 2 ADSL ones, of which the Dommel one is excessively expensive (&euro;150/month).

### CONCLUSION

For Brussels, <a href="http://www.coditel.be/Default.aspx?tabid=305" target="_blank">Coditel</a> is still a very good option (now if they could update that <a href="http://www.coditel.net/ENfaq.asp" target="_blank">empty FAQ page</a> that doesn&#8217;t seem to have been updated since the nineties). There is no point in switching from SpeedClick to MegaClick for the GB/mon only, but if the speed is really the double (in theory 20Mbps instead of 10Mbps) it might be a nice upgrade. I don&#8217;t need something like 200GB/month yet, but if I would, then <a href="http://www.realdsl.be/broadband.php" target="_blank">RealDSL</a> would be the best option.

If you live in Flanders and your main concern is speed, go <a href="http://www.telenet.be/nl/thuis/internet/producten/expressnet_turbo/index.page" target="_blank">Telenet ExpressNet Turbo</a>. If you need loads of GB/month, go <a href="http://www.chello.be/Abonnementen/1949/19496588.html" target="_blank">Chello Extreme</a> (where possible) or <a href="http://www.realdsl.be/broadband.php" target="_blank">RealDSL</a>.

**UPDATE**  
<span style="font-style:italic;">RealDSL does </span><span style="font-weight:bold;">NOT</span> accept any new subscriptions since October 2005, since there seem to be a capacity problem with its bandwidth provider Telenet. [Luc](http://lvb.net/item/2013) and [Cindy](http://www.smetty.be/2005/12/21/goodbye-fulladslacademic-broadband) blogged about this earlier, so I have no excuse for my sloppy research. The only DSL provider with a unlimited bandwidth offer seems to be Dommel, but at an extreme high price. Their &euro;33/50GB is however a good offer. Thanks for the update, [Smetty](http://www.smetty.be)!
