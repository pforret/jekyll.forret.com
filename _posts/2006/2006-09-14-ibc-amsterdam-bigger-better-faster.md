I spent Saturday with Clo at [IBC 2006](http://www.ibc.org) (Amsterdam), an exhibition about content creation, management and delivery. As boring as that may sound, we did see some neat stuff. 

**HARDWARE**  
[<img style="float: right" src="http://static.flickr.com/92/240247494_72843fafae_m.jpg" alt="IBC: Accenture" />](http://www.flickr.com/photos/pforret/240247494)First of all, IBC is a paradise for hardware freaks. I&#8217;ve never seen so many 30&#8243; plus flat screen displays on such a limited surface. One vendor combined 6 of those into one impressive control room. Accenture was showing off a huge touchscreen display for geo-applications, which reminded of Minory Report. Apple had dropped off several truckloads of equipment, including a full XServe RAID rack which probably packed more than 30 Terabytes. A nice rack to look at.

We saw a lot of steadycam demos, and one guy did a steadycam demo that was some mix between martial arts and ballet. 

All vendors of blue screen/green screen solutions for broadcast purposes showed of their equipment with one or more blond girls. Must be the best hair colour for blue screen effects.

**SOFTWARE**

Apple showed some neat Final Cut Studio stuff. Their podcast presentation was less of a surprise, the presenter didn&#8217;t seem to actually understand what he meant with &#8220;and then you just make the RSS&#8221;. Soundtrack Pro looks like a neat application.

They had really comfy chairs and awesome demos of Maya (3D animation), Smoke (editing), Fire (editing) and Lustre (color-grading) &#8211; running on a 4-processor Linux system. Since I&#8217;ve never seen a lot of live digital movie editing, I might have been easy to baffle. But what those presenters could do in 5 minutes &#8230; Don&#8217;t trust anything you see on a screen ever again.

Since we were there with a cheap-o exhibition ticket, and could not attend the conference, we missed out on a lot of the digital cinema presentations. I did see the [RED](http://www.red.com) booth: the first 4K digital camera ([4520 x 2540 pixels](http://web.forret.com/tools/megapixel.asp?width=4520&height=2540&title=RED+ONE+camera)) that records in 2540p (not interlaced). Besides the obvious technical achievements (the camera was demo&#8217;d for the first time at IBC) you also have to admire the [buzz-marketing](http://www.dvguru.com/2006/09/11/ibc-red-galore/) [around](http://www.hdforindies.com/2006/09/notes-on-reds-4k-projected-footage-at.html) [the](http://www.freshdv.com/2006/09/red-digital-cinema-screens-4k-footage.html) [product](http://crunchgear.com/2006/09/08/seeing-red-ultra-high-def/).
