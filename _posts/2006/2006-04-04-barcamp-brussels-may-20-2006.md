So there it is: after some feedback on my [Barcamp announcement post](http://blog.forret.com/2006/03/barcamp-brussels-may-2006/), we fixed the date and location for Barcamp Brussels!

**DETAILS**

  * Saturday **May 20th 2006** (breakfast at 9am, presentations start at 10h and end around 18h)
  * [International Presscenter](http://presscenter.org/) (_RÃ©sidence Palace_)  
<img width="300" src="http://presscenter.org/images/Nieuwe_beelden/patio.jpg" alt="Presscenter Patio" />  
    (although: dress code casual &#8211; no suits ðŸ˜‰ )
  * All presentations can be put on the presentation board upon arrival. There will be 3 to 4 presentation rooms for simultaneous topics.
  * there will be free Wifi, food, drinks and lots of hi-tech around.

One remark: although this might seem to be a geek-event par excellence, this is not for-geeks-only. There will be technical presentations, granted, but we also expect interesting talks about social, psychological and esthetic topics. You do not need programming skills or an engineering degree, just a vivid interest in modern society. You&#8217;re interested in the etymology of smilies, the effect of gaming on ADHD, the psychological implications of serif and sans-serif fonts? There&#8217;s a topic for your presentation!

**HOW TO PARTICIPATE**

  * All attendees must give a demo, a session, or [help out in some way](http://barcamp.org/BarCampBrusselsForTheImpatient).
  * Add your name to the list on [barcamp.org/BarCampBrusselsForTheImpatient](http://barcamp.org/BarCampBrusselsForTheImpatient)
  * you can add the following badge to your blog/site/emails: <p style="text-align: center">

    </p>
    
    everyone is invited to participate and the more the merrier.</li> 
    
      * subscribe to the Barcamp Brussels [Yahoo group](http://groups.yahoo.com/group/barcampbrussels/) to keep posted on developments and connect with other Barcampers (to prepare a joint presentation/demo or to arrange for car pooling)</ul> 
    
    Everyone who wants to help out for the practical organisation (mostly the week before) can drop me a line or tell me through the Yahoo group. I already want to thank [Bart](http://webguide.fgov.be/nl/) for helping us out with the venue and hope we can welcome a whole bunch of you on May 20th!
