I&#8217;ve started a public [Google calendar for tango events (milonga&#8217;s, salons) in and around Brussels](http://blog.forret.com/projects/tango-activities-in-brussels/). My preferred site, milonga.be has gone down, the agenda at [tango.be](http://www.tango.be/) is quite ugly (it uses frames \*shiver\* ), and Marisa & Oliver&#8217;s [agenda](http://www.marisayoliver.com/en/brusselsagenda.html) cannot be exported. So I made my own:

One of the things I wanted to test out is how easy it was to visualize the calendar on other sites. [Google Calendar](http://www.google.com/calendar) publishes in [iCal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICalendar) or XML format, so I looked for a package out there that could visualize this. After fooling around with [phpiCalendar](http://sourceforge.net/projects/phpicalendar/) for a while (doesn&#8217;t work that well with Google Calendar, nor with remote iCal URLs), I discovered that Google [already has provided a wizard](http://www.google.com/support/calendar/bin/answer.py?answer=41207) for just that. Embedding this piece of code into your HTML will give you an up-to-date calendar of [Tango activities in Brussels](http://blog.forret.com/projects/tango-activities-in-brussels/):

The data is also available as an XML feed (a variant of [Atom](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_(standard)), actually) but not in a very useful way. The data inside the feed (the `item` blocks) does not contain essential fields like _start time_ and _event location_ in separate fields. They are included in the HTML-formatted _summary_ and _content_ fields, so you would have to parse those to extract those details.

John Udell has [published a script](http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2006/06/13.html) that fills in `where` and `when` tags in an Atom field (based on the `http://schemas.google.com/g/2005` namespace), but Google does apparently not use those for publishing their XML feeds. Weird &#8230;
