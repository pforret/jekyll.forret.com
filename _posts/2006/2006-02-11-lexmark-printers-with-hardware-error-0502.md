Good tip for the [Lexmark All-in-one inkjet printer](http://www.lexmark.com/US/products/family/0,1222,AIO,00.html) owners (mine is the [X6170](http://www.lexmark.com/US/products/overview/0,1224,MzUxNHwx,00.html)):

[<img  class="alignright" style="float: right;" src="http://static.flickr.com/31/98393867_e286ea59ca_t.jpg" alt="Lexmark Hardware Error 0502" width="100" height="75" />](http://www.flickr.com/photos/pforret/98393867/ "Photo Sharing")After some months of use, your printer might get the habit of stopping in the middle of a page and showing &#8220;`Hardware Error 0502`&#8221; on the LCD display. If you leave the printer alone for a while, it might start printing again. Then again, it might not. Pretty annoying.

The [Lexmark support site](http://support.lexmark.com/cgi-perl/knowledgebase.cgi?ccs=229:1:0:385:0:0&emeaframe=&docid=ENUS16536) will let you power off, remove the power cord for 30 seconds (!!), take out the cartridges and fiddle with some encoder strip. This whole procedure might take you up to 30 minutes and **it will not help** (been there, done that).

The real answer is given by a person called &#8216;clem&#8217;:

This works! Clean the sucker with a paper towel (another page talks about re-lubricating the thing, but that was not necessary in my case). The towel will be black (ink residu, presumably), but there you go printing to your heart&#8217;s desire again.

A big thank-you to _Clem_, Google and the wisdom of crowds!

UPDATE: also seems to work for some Dell printers (some of them are manufactured by Lexmark)
