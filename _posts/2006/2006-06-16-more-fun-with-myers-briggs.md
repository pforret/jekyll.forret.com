I&#8217;ve been reading quitea lot on Myers-Briggs for my previous post &#8220;[Myers-Briggs typology](http://blog.forret.com/2006/06/myers-briggs-typology-im-an-enfp/)&#8220;, and some of it is too good not to post it here, so here is my second MBTI post! I&#8217;ve also made an new [MBTI web tool](http://web.forret.com/tools/mbti.asp) for my web tools collection, that you can use to quickly check the facts for each type.

### MBTI at first sight?

Get this: according to [socionics](http://socionics.com/advan/vi/vi.htm), it is possible to do Visual Identification (V.I.) of the Myers-Briggs type. They prove it by showing 4 pictures (Malcolm McDowell, Sting, and two familiar actors-I-can&#8217;t-name) with -granted- similar features, and they&#8217;re all ISTJ (Sting a duty fulfiller?). I&#8217;ll be honest, I don&#8217;t buy this. I know that you can sometimes guess character traits from someone&#8217;s face (e.g. a &#8216;kind&#8217; face vs. a &#8216;hard&#8217; face), and I can understand how your physical attributes (pretty/ugly, thin/chubby) _might_ influence your behaviour and consequently your MBTI type, but I&#8217;m not sure this method would withstand a critical scientific eye.

### You&#8217;re a dyslexic INFJ? What are the odds?

[<img  width="500" src="http://static.flickr.com/98/220816006_bf15a09715.jpg" alt="MBTI distribution" height="208" />](http://web.forret.com/tools/mbti.asp?lang=EN&color=y "Photo Sharing")  
The population is not evenly distributed over the 16 subtypes, some are more common than others. According to statistics from wikipedia, the most common types are [ISFJ](http://web.forret.com/tools/mbti.asp?type=ISFP&lang=EN) (13.8%), [ESFJ](http://web.forret.com/tools/mbti.asp?type=ESFP&lang=EN) (12.3%) and [ISTJ](http://web.forret.com/tools/mbti.asp?type=ISTJ&lang=EN) (11.6%). The least common categories are [INFJ](http://web.forret.com/tools/mbti.asp?type=INFJ&lang=EN) (1.5%), [ENTJ](http://web.forret.com/tools/mbti.asp?type=ENTJ&lang=EN) (1.8%) and [INTJ](http://web.forret.com/tools/mbti.asp?type=INTJ&lang=EN) (2.1%). Since the most prominent ISFJ only differs by 1 character from the least occurring INFJ, one could speculate that the &#8216;N&#8217; (Intuitive) component does not match well with the &#8216;I&#8217; (Introvert), &#8216;F&#8217; (Feeling) and/or &#8216;J&#8217; (Judging). My guess is that a &#8216;J&#8217; normally goes together with an &#8216;S&#8217; (Sensing), which makes the I**N**FJ a weird combo (looking at the other N/J stats, this works out). This actually means that the 2nd and 4th criterium are \*gasp\* correlated.

Also interesting, not every person likes to talk about his Myers-Briggs label. I&#8217;ve done a quick Google count for each of the types. A high number can mean: people of type X like to talk about themselves, or X is a type that is talked about a lot by people in general. So the reason can be vanity or (in-)sanity. The low hitcount types are [ESFJ](http://web.forret.com/tools/mbti.asp?type=ESFJ&lang=EN) (107K hits), [ISFP](http://web.forret.com/tools/mbti.asp?type=ISFP&lang=EN) (146K) and [ENFJ](http://web.forret.com/tools/mbti.asp?type=ENFJ&lang=EN) (156K). At the other side we find the popular topics of: [INTP](http://web.forret.com/tools/mbti.asp?type=INTP&lang=EN) (588K), [INTJ](http://web.forret.com/tools/mbti.asp?type=INTJ&lang=EN) (724K) and -get ready- [ISTP](http://web.forret.com/tools/mbti.asp?type=ISTP&lang=EN) (1.190K). The reason for this last number might be that there is contamination from the likes of &#8220;Institut Sup√©rieur des Techniques Productiques&#8221; and the &#8220;International Solar Terrestrial Physics&#8221; NASA program. I don&#8217;t see why the &#8216;Mechanic&#8217; type would enjoy so much more interest.

### I&#8217;d marry you, but you&#8217;re an ISTJ

This Myers-Briggs system gives an new angle to the whole boy-meets-girl thing too! Imagine you&#8217;re an [ENFP](http://web.forret.com/tools/mbti.asp?type=ENFP&lang=EN) (&#8216;Inspirer&#8217;), like me. Can you just shack up with anybody? Nope! Any girl from my complete opposite, [ISTJ](http://web.forret.com/tools/mbti.asp?type=ISTJ&lang=EN) or &#8216;Duty fulfiller&#8217;, is obviously a no-go: we would have a &#8216;[conflicting](http://socionics.com/rel/cnf.htm)&#8216; relationship (you can read the details, but for now: it&#8217;s bad). But that&#8217;s not all: with [ENFJ](http://web.forret.com/tools/mbti.asp?type=ENFJ&lang=EN) (Giver) I&#8217;d have a [quasi-identical](http://socionics.com/rel/qid.htm) relationship: major misunderstanding. If I were to have dinner with e.g. [Claudia](http://claudiaschiepers.typepad.com/claudias_blog/2006/06/myersbriggs.html), that&#8217;s something I&#8217;d have to watch out for (and also not eat spaghetti with a white shirt). If you&#8217;re not easily pleased (which I&#8217;m not), then ENTJ, ESFJ, INTJ, ISFJ, INFP and INTP are also out of the question. Which basically leaves me with the [ISTP](http://web.forret.com/tools/mbti.asp?type=ISTP&lang=EN) (Mechanic), [ESTP](http://web.forret.com/tools/mbti.asp?type=ESTP&lang=EN) (Doer) and [INFJ](http://web.forret.com/tools/mbti.asp?type=INFJ&lang=EN) (Scientist), or only something like 12% of the total population. Add to that requirements for intelligence, humour and some aesthetic considerations -oh, and the girl being single- and one can see how celibate can be such a hard condition to solve. Check out the logic on these inter-type relations on this [quasi-mathematical page](http://socionics.com/rel/rel.htm). Of course, if you believe [a different opinion](http://www.personalitypage.com/ENFP_rel.html), I&#8217;d have to be looking out for [INTJ](http://web.forret.com/tools/mbti.asp?type=INTJ) and [INFJ](http://web.forret.com/tools/mbti.asp?type=INFJ). Oh well &#8230;

If you want to &#8216;find your type&#8217; (in whatever meaning), use my [MBTI tool](http://web.forret.com/tools/mbti.asp).
