Just a thought I had:  
if the &#8220;[rule of thirds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_thirds)&#8221; is so effective for photo composition, could it also be used to create more pleasing Powerpoint presentation designs?  
An example of the layout dimensions could be like this (don&#8217;t focus on the boring picture/font, just the relative placement):

Well, it has been recently discussed on [Presentation Zen](http://presentationzen.blogs.com/presentationzen/2006/06/the_power_of_th.html), with some really nice pictures. However, judging by the standard templates in Powerpoint, the people at the &#8216;Microsoft Office Powerpoint&#8217; team are not yet aware of this rule and other [design principles](http://www.digital-web.com/articles/principles_of_design/).

Keep in mind, this is just a tiny make-up aspect of a presentation. There are more important issues like, &#8230; erm, content:

> Presentations largely stand or fall on the quality, relevance, and integrity of the content. If your numbers are boring, then you&#8217;ve got the wrong numbers. If your words or images are not on point, making them dance in color won&#8217;t make them relevant. Audience boredom is usually a content failure, not a decoration failure.

> * Use a lot of slides. Change them rapidly.  
> * The slides go with the words&#8211;they aren&#8217;t just there as backdrops.  
> * The slides are NOT the words. They represent the idea you&#8217;re talking about, either directly or emotionally.
