Writing code in your browser, it&#8217;s coming this way, I tell you! Some indications:

my own [WikiRAD article](http://blog.forret.com/2005/07/online-software-development-the-wikirad/) (July 2005)
:   Playing around with PHP and wikis at the same time made me think on how web-based editing and compiling would be a good way to develop and run web applications

[Feed43](http://feed43.com)
:   Create an RSS feed out of any web page by using regular expressions with a nifty Web2.0 user interface. Lots of services are based on URLs and use RSS as input, so this can be the start of a first application. E.g. I just created an [RSS feed](http://feed43.com/stubru_playlists.xml) for the [Stubru playlist pages](http://www.stubru.be/html/stubru_web/programmas/playlist/index.html) out of a Stubru Javascript file. Imagine I could now tell Feed43:  
    `for each item in feed_that_I_just_created {<br />
parse_the item_url<br />
publish an rss feed for this item_url as feed_url_X<br />
}`  
    and then start working with that content too.

[Amazon S3](http://aws.amazon.com/s3)
:   web-based outsourced storage for any application, which made [John Keyes](http://jkeyes.com/2006/03/ten_ideas_for_amazon_s3_applic.php) and [Peter Van Dijck](http://poorbuthappy.com/ease/archives/2006/03/14/3086/can-you-use-amazon-s3-to-create-the-new-flickr-killer) to ask themselves: &#8220;Can you use Amazon S3 to create the new Flickr killer?&#8221;, and which made me think: but what if not only the storage, but the whole program was run by a 3rd party?

[Iamalpha](http://iamalpha.com) (via [Richard McManus](http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/aols_new_module.php))
:   AOL&#8217;s new initiative for building microformat-based applications. It&#8217;s a bit early to grasp the extent what what they&#8217;re trying to accomplish, but I think it&#8217;s potentially more than just widgets. They don&#8217;t have a web-based IDE yet, but they do have a copy/paste [code-validator](http://iamalpha.com/.developer/validate.jsp). Most importantly: the applications are run by AOL!

[YouOS](http://www.youos.com) (via [Jeremy Zawodny](http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/006495.html))
:   [<img src="http://static.flickr.com/41/116327567_416a2a0cb1_m.jpg" width="240" alt="YouOS: web-based IDE" />](http://www.flickr.com/photos/pforret/116327567/ "Photo Sharing")  
    a web-based OS that allows you to develop Javascript-based applications in a web-based IDE, with version control and compiling. It&#8217;s one of the products coming out of [Paul Graham](http://www.paulgraham.com/)&#8216;s [Y-combinator](http://www.ycombinator.com/) startup incubator.

For me, these are all indicators of a trend: there will be a day when you don&#8217;t need your own machines to run your complete (complex) web applications: the storage, the authentication, the aggregation, the statistics will all run on 3rd party servers, some of which you pay, some of which you don&#8217;t. I&#8217;m not talking about service providers like [Ning](http://www.ning.com): they allow you to configure/customize a web app that _they_ developed, not you.  
I see a [web-based IDE for RubyOnRails](http://www.deveiate.org/projects/JohnHenry) coming, I think [Yahoo](http://developer.yahoo.com/), [Google](http://code.google.com/) and [Amazon](http://aws.typepad.com/) will building the bricks too, and pretty soon you will be able to develop a Flickr-like photo management application and run it without having a machine of your own:

  * user/group management: Yahoo or Google or Microsoft&#8217;s single sign-on
  * photo storage: Amazon S3
  * database: some future version of [Google Base](http://base.google.com/)
  * email: some future version of Yahoo or Google groups
  * photo tags/folksonomy: some future version of del.icio.us (see my [Folksonomizer](http://blog.forret.com/2005/02/folksonomizer-generic-folksonomy-service/) post)
  * comments: some future version of [Gtalk](http://www.google.com/talk/) or [Campfire](http://www.campfirenow.com/) (mental note to self: write something about commentalizer and use of URI as web API)

Give it another year.
