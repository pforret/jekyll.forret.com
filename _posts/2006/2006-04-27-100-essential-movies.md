Jim Emerson has listed the 100 movies (103 actually) one should have seen to form an opinion about film

> (&#8230;) the movies you just kind of figure everybody ought to have seen in order to have any sort of informed discussion about movies. They&#8217;re the common cultural currency of our time, the basic cinematic texts that everyone should know, at minimum, to be somewhat &#8220;movie-literate.&#8221;

That is a brave thing to do, because movie buffs will never agree on what those 100 movies should be, so his effort is bound to get contested. Which is what I&#8217;m going to do now.

Looking at his choice, I would say the said Mr Emerson is English speaking and born before 1960. Look at the histogram:

**Quick stats**  
85% of the listed movies are English spoken (mostly American). 70% of the movies were made before 1970. The best decade was the fifties (20 movies &#8211; from Hitchcock, Kurosawa, Wilder, Kazan, Godard &#8230;), then the seventies (19 movies &#8211; from Coppola, Scorsese, De Palma, Altman) and third the sixties (18 movies &#8211; Fellini, Kubrick, Bergman, Lean, Nichols).

**Best Directors**  
Obviously, no [female directors](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_female_directors) in the list, no Jane Campion or Sofia Coppola.

**Foreign movies**  
It&#8217;s been a sery silent last 30 years for non-english, non-US movies, one would conclude by looking at Emerson&#8217;s list. France and Germany started strong the first half of the 20th century, Japan had a moment de gloire around &#8217;50-&#8217;55, Italy had some luck with Fellini in the early sixties, but since then it&#8217;s been really quiet. I&#8217;m not a big expert on early European film, but I&#8217;m just wondering. Bertolucci? Kieslowski?

**Recent movies**  
Only 6 movies from the nineties make it onto the list:

  * &#8220;[GoodFellas](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099685/)&#8221; &#8211; 1990 &#8211; Martin Scorsese
  * &#8220;[The Crying Game](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0104036/)&#8221; &#8211; 1992 &#8211; Neil Jordan
  * &#8220;[Schindler&#8217;s List](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108052/)&#8221; &#8211; 1993 &#8211; Steven Spielberg
  * &#8220;[Pulp Fiction](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110912/)&#8221; &#8211; 1994 &#8211; Quentin Tarantino
  * &#8220;[Fargo](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116282/)&#8221; &#8211; 1995 &#8211; Joel & Ethan Coen
  * &#8220;[Fight Club](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0137523/)&#8221; &#8211; 1999 &#8211; David Fincher

I&#8217;ve seen them all, except for Fight Club, and they&#8217;re all good movies, but couldn&#8217;t that list be longer? Shouldn&#8217;t one at least have seen &#8220;Silence of the lambs&#8221; to understand &#8220;I&#8217;m having an old friend for dinner&#8221;? And what about &#8230; \*he says while shifting his legs\* &#8220;Basic Instinct&#8221;? What did &#8220;Thelma and Louise&#8221; do for emancipation and girl-girl action? The &#8220;Lion King&#8221; &#8211; &#8216;Hakuna matata&#8217; and all that? Isn&#8217;t that more relevant than &#8220;Nosferatu&#8221; in this day and age?

**Checklist**  
The list is of course a good checklist to see what great movies you still have to sit through. I just did the counting, I haven&#8217;t seen half of them yet (I&#8217;m around 45%). I have a feeling that if someone would make a top 100 of the last thirty years, I&#8217;d be way above 50%.  
Remarkable fact: Victor Fleming &#8211; a name that did not ring a bell with me &#8211; finished &#8220;Gone with the wind&#8221; and &#8220;The wizard of Oz&#8221; in the same year: 1939. 

> Ironically Fleming was brought in on both pictures to replace other directors and smooth out the troubled productions, a feat he accomplished masterfully.
