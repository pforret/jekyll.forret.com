Google has just confirmed to have bought <a href="http://www.upstartle.com/" target="_blank">Upstartle</a>, the creators of [Writely](http://www.writely.com) ([Writely Blog](http://writely.blogspot.com/2006/03/google-yep-google.html)/[GoogleBlog](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2006/03/writely-so.html) via [Om Malik](http://gigaom.com/2006/03/08/google-writely-in-talks)). Apart from being good news for the founders of Upstartle, this also indicates Google&#8217;s determination to make the fat client history and allow users to do all their business through on-line services.

> Now buying Writely is in line with Google thinking of using browser for everything. I mean an online word processor, and online excel spread sheet make a lot more sense than making people switch to OpenOffice.

Om started making a Microsoft office/Google Office comparison matrix, and I took the liberty of adding some stuff to it:

### Productivity on-line

I will list a number of (&#8216;productivity&#8217;) application types, with the current (&#8216;fat client&#8217;) most used software, and the on-line web2.0-ish (&#8216;thin client&#8217;) applications that are trying to take over (although for some areas the online applications are only just at the beginning):
