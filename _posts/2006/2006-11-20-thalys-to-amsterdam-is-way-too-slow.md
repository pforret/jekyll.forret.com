In 1987 it was decided that a high-speed train connection between Brussels, Paris, Amsterdam and Köln would be built. [Ten years later](http://www.thalys.com/be/nl/over-thalys/onderneming/geschiedenis), the [Thalys](http://www.thalys.com) train already achieves a travel time of 1h25 to Paris (over 200km/h). So the Thalys is this High-Speed-Train? Well, not always, as I experienced recently. While travelling to Paris is fast enough for daily commute, the train to Amsterdam is even slower than driving.

I actually had to go to the [Hilversum Mediapark](http://www.mediapark.nl/), the nerve center of the Netherlands&#8217; broadcast industry. Apparently you&#8217;re supposed to take your car there, because the only train connection from Amsterdam to it is a small stop-everywhere train that only runs twice an hour. That combined with a Thalys that only runs _once per two hours_, is the reason it took me almost six hours to get back to Brussels in the evening. When I had to wait for an hour and a half in the Amsterdam station, I went to the only reasonable restaurant there, and when I asked the waiter for the non-smokers zone, he frowned and said &#8220;This is a restaurant designed like a &#8216;grand café&#8217;, sir, smoking is just part of that&#8221;. So I had to take a table next to the toilet, to be able to enjoy my meal without disgusting smoke in my face. As you might guess, it was not the best of evenings.

I wondered if it was just an idea or if the Thalys to Amsterdam is really that slow. It actually is:

While the Thalys to Paris reaches an average speed of 214 km/h, a speed we can safely say is improbable to do by car, travelling to Amsterdam does not even go above 80km/h. You&#8217;re even faster in London (366km), under the Channel and everything, than in Asterdam (210km). I will not be using that train again until they finally get it up to a decent speed in [2007](http://www.thalys.com/be/nl/over-thalys/onderneming/vooruitzichten): 1h30 from Amsterdam instead of 2h39. About bloody time.
