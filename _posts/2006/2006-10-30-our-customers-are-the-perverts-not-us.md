Cain is the founder and CEO of [Realroot](http://www.realroot.be), hoster of a large collection of high-bandwidth, and often NSFW, websites &#8211; including Zattevrienden, Zattemadammen, Wijfzonderlijf, Gallerygalore and Thisislife. He is known for being a shrewd business man and not the most subtle of conversationalists. But the way he speaks about his pr0n-consuming users in this article sets a new high for self-confessed customer contempt.

Some (translated) quotes:

>   * (about his early days as a self-taught consultant) I could bluff my way into any company as a consultant. I would throw some complicated terms at the IT-manager I was negotiating with. Generally he was not that clever and was easily intimidated.
>   * _(about access logs)_ I can see it right away when a top minister is j*rking off on one of our chicks.
>   * A belgian webcam visitor stays logged in for 7 minutes on average, and a Dutch one for 15 minutes. &#8220;A Dutchman w*nks at half the speed of a Belgian&#8221; concludes CR.
>   * I am very happy with the sex addicts, they make me a lot of money. We help them get off. Our customers are perverts, not us. _(not sure how to translate &#8220;vetzak&#8221; in English)_
>   * The eyeballs are the watchers, the w*nkers: our customers. In the posh cities _(Amsterdam, London, Paris)_ are the watchers with money, the rich w*nkers.
>   * _(&#8220;Aren&#8217;t the customers pathetic?&#8221;)_ Maybe they are. Amongst them are a lot of frustrated and sorry bastards. They have a right to our help.
>   * Actually, the guy just wants to talk. He&#8217;s safe at home, with his pants down, in his own house. He doesn&#8217;t want to go into therapy. Hij prefers doing his thing anonymously, with a naked virtual girl from Rumania.

It&#8217;s funny that in these days when [Kathy](http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/), [Seth](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/) and [Tara](http://www.horsepigcow.com) are trying to define how you should try to treat your customer with respect and start a dialogue, there is such a blatant example of how the exact opposite can also be succesful. 

Isn&#8217;t Cain afraid his customers might read the newspaper and feel offended? Frankly, I don&#8217;t think he gives a damn.
