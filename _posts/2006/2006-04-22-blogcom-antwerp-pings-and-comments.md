The event was organised by [Jeroen](http://lichtgeraakt.carreconfiture.be/?p=372) and some 50 bloggers showed up. No speeches, but lots of mingling and chatting. We&#8217;ll have to remember that for the next Brussels blogger&#8217;s meeting.

Now finally I know what they look like and what funny accent they have: [Pol](http://www.polskaya.be), [Michael](http://www.7seconden.be), [Dries](http://buytaert.net/), [Bart](http://www.mouseover.be), [Bruno](http://bvlg.blogspot.com), [Kevin](http://www.clopin.be) and [Stefan](http://www.kandl.be/). Strictly speaking it was the first time I saw [Pietel](http://www.pietel.be) in person too, but after being bombarded with his face as a [terrorist](http://www.flickr.com/photos/beau/121176189/) and [messias](http://blog.zog.org/2006/04/coin-coin.html), he basically looked like himself but more human.

**Put the blog in the reader**

New blogs that I added to my reading list: [kleinekeizerin](http://kleinekeizerin.blogspot.com/), [kleintje](http://www.kleintje.be/), [tenderfeelings](http://www.tenderfeelings.be/). Hip hip hooray for girl bloggers.
