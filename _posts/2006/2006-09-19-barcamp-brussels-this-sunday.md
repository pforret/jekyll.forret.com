Five more days to go! Some more tips for those of you who are attending [Barcamp Brussels](http://barcamp.org/BarCampBrussels) on Sunday:

### How to get there

[<img  src="http://static.flickr.com/98/247270705_3714f89703.jpg" width="500" height="423" alt="SAP Lounge: map" />](http://www.flickr.com/photos/pforret/247270705/ "Photo Sharing")  
The [SAP Lounge](http://www.saplounge.be) is located in the Arsenal complex, an old military building that is now turned into fancy offices. The address is **Chaussée de Wavre 950, 1040 Etterbeek**. That is on the corner of the Chaussée de Wavre and the Boulevard Général Jacques, right next to the VUB University. There is a parking for SAP Lounge visitors just before the Colruyt at the right.  
Here is a [map of SAP Lounge](http://www.saplounge.be/images/arsenal_plan_a4.pdf).

### Sponsoring

If you or your company would like to contribute (I will of course mention this kind gesture), please contact me on the day itself.
