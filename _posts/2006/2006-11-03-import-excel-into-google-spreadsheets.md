This is the first time I noticed this: an email in my Gmail with Excel attachments offers me the option to view the document in [Google Spreadsheets](http://search.forret.com/google/google+spreadsheets).

It doesn&#8217;t work for all spreadsheets though (I got an error message on the second document), but it is a nice extra feature to Gmail and Spreadsheets. 

Now they could add this for Powerpoint (via Picasa slideshow?), Visio and all OpenOffice formats, and they just pretty much made the Word/Excel/Visio viewer applications obsolete. Even more importantly: it works on all platforms. Nice one!
