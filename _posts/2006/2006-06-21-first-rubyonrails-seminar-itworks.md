<img style="float: right" src="http://www.rubyonrails.org/images/rails.png" alt="RubyOnRails" />[I.T.Works](http://www.itworks.be), one of Belgiums leading technical training organisers, has cooked up its [first RubyOnRails seminar](http://www.itworks.be/event.php?id=RUBYD1) on Thursday July 6th. Alain Ravet and Werner Ramaekers, both experienced Rails developers, will talk about the advantages of this application development framework.

If you want to understand the logic behind &#8220;convention over configuration&#8221;, &#8220;flexibility is over-rated&#8221;, &#8220;constraints are liberating&#8221; or even &#8220;PHP is the devil; Ruby on Rails is the angel&#8221;([*](http://adactio.com/journal/1082/)): be sure to attend and learn why RoR is so successfull. I, for one, was already quite thrilled to discover Python some years ago, but getting to know RubyOnRails has been a way more exciting experience. It really lets you do cool stuff in less than 15 minutes (see [numerous screencasts](http://blog.forret.com/2005/12/rad-frameworks-development-bliss-in-20-min-or-less/)). Also, if you want to meet some of the early adopters (developers as well as agencies) of RoR in Belgium, the seminar is a good place to start. I will also be there!
