I am already counting down to January 1st 2007 (125 days to go). From that day onwards, it will be forbidden to smoke in Belgian restaurants. Hallelujah!

Some of you smokers out there are offended I should rejoice in such an event? Just remember that for us, non-smokers, cigarette smoke at the dinner table is as enjoyable as a (smelly) fart in the face. We&#8217;ve had to put up with that for way too long. 

The announcements: [Restaurants rookvrij vanaf 2007 (NL)](http://smoking.visualizor.com/blog/2006/08/restaurants-rookvrij-vanaf-2007/) or [Restaurants sans fumeurs en 2007 (FR)](http://smoking.visualizor.com/blog/2006/08/restaurants-sans-fumeurs-en-2007/)

### Countdown

If you too are eagerly awaiting the beginning of smokefree dining, you can add this countdown clock to your blog. The cigarette becomes shorter and shorter until it will be burnt up on Jan 1st 2007. Instructions on [smoking.visualizor.com](http://smoking.visualizor.com/blog/countdown/)
