[Wikipedia.org](http://www.wikipedia.org) is awesome. Who would have thought that building a knowledge system based on voluntary contributions from just about anyone who wants to, would work? 

So what would happen if one would combine the [Wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki) concept with the other superstar of [social software](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_software), [blogging](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog)? Wouldn&#8217;t it be nice that you could have the chronological posts, but also clickable keywords, and the possibility to easily edit them &#8211; and let them be edited by others? And then find a catchy name for the combined concept, like a &#8216;[bliki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bliki)&#8216;?

Unfortunately I am not the first person to think of the concept, nor the name: [perl.com](http://www.perl.com/pub/a/2003/12/18/bryar.html) mentioned bliki&#8217;s in Dec 2003, [Martin Fowler](http://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/WhatIsaBliki.html) talked about it in May 2003, and David M Johnson already in [Sept 2002](http://www.rollerweblogger.org/page/roller/20020906).  
One of the pioneers was apparently the incredibly extensive [www.jahsonic.com](http://www.jahsonic.com): basically a huge Wiki-like site. Its author, Jan Geerinck, also has a [blog page](http://www.jahsonic.com/Blog.html) (however without RSS or Atom feed). The blog was started back in 2001.

Some products that implement Blog/Wiki hybrids are: [YACS](http://www.yetanothercommunitysystem.com/yacs/), [Fromage](http://sourceforge.net/projects/fromage/), [Bloki](http://www.bloki.com/), [SnipSnap](http://snipsnap.org/) and [Roller](http://www.rollerweblogger.org/page/roller/20020906).  
[SnipSnap](http://snipsnap.org/space/Bliki) was developed by someone from the [Fraunhofer](http://www.first.fraunhofer.de/) Institute (DE) and looks very promising. [Roller](http://www.rollerweblogger.org/page/roller/20020906) is used by Sun Microsystems for the [employee blogs](http://blogs.sun.com/roller/).
