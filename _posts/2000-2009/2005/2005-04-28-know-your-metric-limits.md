From Wired &#8211; July 2004:

> The universe comes in a box. It's a big box, and you almost never see the walls, but its boundaries are immovable &#8211; the speed of light, gravity, the way atoms interact. Even if time and space are unlimited and illimitable, physics, chemistry, and biology dictate maxima and minima in the universe. Like the strict meter and structure of a sonnet, they make the final product all the more beautiful. &#8211; Adam Rogers

5 billion Years &#8211; Maximum time Earth has left. </p> 
:   That's when the sun goes red giant and expands past Earth's orbit.</p> 
    
    5.4 * 10<sup>-44</sup> seconds &#8211; Shortest possible time. </p> 
    
    :   Any shorter and quantum mechanics can't tell whether events are simultaneous. </p> 
        
        1.419 * 10<sup>26</sup> meter (15 billion light-years) &#8211; Maximum distance we can see. </p> 
        
        :   The universe is [about 15 billion years old](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_bang) &#8211; this is light's travel time. </p> 
            
            1.6256 * 10<sup>-35</sup> meter (6.4 * 10<sup>-34</sup> inches) &#8211; Shortest possible distance. </p> 
            
            :   Planck length: any shorter and quantum mechanics can't tell between here and there. </p> 
                
                34.92 km (21.7 miles) &#8211; Maximum height of a mountain on Earth. </p> 
                
                :   Uplift reaches equilibrium with pressure at the base. </p> 
                    
                    3.048 * 10<sup>-7</sup> m (1.2 * 10<sup>-5</sup> inches) &#8211; Minimum size of an actively growing cell. </p> 
                    
                    :   Free-living cells need room for a full genome, proteins, and guts. </p>

                        :   Gravity overcomes surface tension in the plant's circulatory system. </p> 
                            
                            265 &#8211; Minimum number of protein-coding genes for life. </p> 
                            
                            :   As seen in the smallest known single-cell organism. </p> 
                                
                                200 million years &#8211; Maximum age of sub-oceanic crust. </p> 
                                
                                :   Older than that: it cools, becomes denser, and &#8220;subducts&#8221; back into magma. </p>
