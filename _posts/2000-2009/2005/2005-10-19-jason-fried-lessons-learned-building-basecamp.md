![](http://static.flickr.com/1/631535_205cad1468_m.jpg)An interesting speech on the [IT conversations](http://www.itconversations.com) podcast from the [O'Reilly Emerging Technology conference](http://conferences.oreillynet.com/etech/) from Jason Fried, the founder of [37 Signals](http://37signals.com/). He explains what he's learned while creating the [Basecamp application](http://www.basecamphq.com/) (web-based project management).  
For instance: his 5 criteria for hiring people in small teams. They have to be &#8230;

  * **positive** and enthusiastic (_&#8220;I'll take someone who's happy and average, over someone who's a guru but is disgruntled and frustrated&#8221;_) 
  * **well rounded**: people that can do multiple things, not just one
  * **quick learners**: people who can figure out what something new is about
  * **trustworthy**: you can trust them to find a solution, you don't need to clean up after them
  * **good writers**: people communicate through email/messenger more than verbally

His 4 key points:

  1. **watch out for inertia**: you need to be able to change quickly, so watch out for locking yourself in (long term contracts, hardware/software choices) 
  2. **embrace constraints**: limited time, limited people, limited funding, they make you creative (_&#8220;spending money should be the hardest thing you ever do&#8221;_)
  3. **get real**: start building from the interface, start with minimal features, allow for making errors online, admit them and fix them
  4. **manage your debt**: if you create debt (financial or by careless hacking, bad coding), fix it sooner than later

He has well-defined interesting ideas: &#8220;_Every decision is temporary_&#8220;, &#8220;_Perpetual Beta is nonsense_&#8220;, &#8230;
