Just received a sweet little email from self-proclaimed &#8220;professional communicator&#8221; Jody Robb, about a [free RGB-2-CMYK converter](http://www.forret.com/tools/color.asp) tool of mine:

> From: Jody Robb [mailto:jr@\***]  
> Subject: Poxy program
> 
> I wasted ten minutes on your poxy program. If you�re gonna put stuff up on the net, make sure it works, arsehole.
> 
> People like you who waste other people�s time and resources to show off are the slime in the gutter of the internet.
> 
> Jody Robb  
> Digital Media Producer/Consultant  
> (&#8230;) Australia

followed by an email 5 minutes later: _&#8220;It does work but you're still a fuckwit&#8221;_.

You make us non-professional communicators blush, Jody!
