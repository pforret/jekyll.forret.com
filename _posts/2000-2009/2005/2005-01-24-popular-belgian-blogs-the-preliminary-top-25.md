[Luc Van Braekel](http://lvb.net) has developed a service called [Blogium.be](http://www.blogium.be), to find new emerging &#8216;hot' links on the front pages of Belgian blogs. His start database is obviously a big list of URLs of Belgian bloggers. I think that a good additional function of Blogium could be to display a ranking of these, ordered by some kind of meta-calculation over things like: Google Pagerank, #incoming links for all search engines, posting recency/frequency (so deserted blogs disappear from the ranking in time), intra-belgium link traffic, &#8230;

Let's set up a conceptual demo: I take a list of 50 Belgian/Flemish blogs, and use a tool called the &#8216;Link Popularity Check' (via [Xander](http://www.zxz.nl/weblog/2005/01/pagerank-update-en-daarna-direct-een.html)) to check the # of incoming links. First some important disclaimers:

  * my tiny list is **by no means complete or representative**, these are the blogs I know, or that I have come across. Luc's told me he's got 10s of thousands blogs in his list, maybe by now already 100s. 
  * Incoming links/link popularity is **not the only defining criterium** one should use to quantify &#8216;importance'. It was just an easy one to check. 
  * **URL stuff**: because of the way the tool works, I cannot include blogs that don't have their own domain. Also, xyz.be links are not the same as www.xyz.be links. I typically took the one with the highest numbers, I did not add the numbers. 
  * I did not include sites like [saait.be](http://www.saait.be) or [zurf.be](http://www.zurf.be), because they are not a blog. No feed, no blog. 
  * Some blogs are in English, some in Dutch. If you write in English on topics like web design, and you really know your shit, you might end up a very popular site (as can be witnessed below). If you write in Dutch about fishing shrimp in the North Sea, tough luck.

And the top 25 is:

  1. **[www.coolios.net](http://www.coolios.net): 149328 hits**  
    Probably the only shockblog we have that comes close to the Dutch competition ([Flabber](http://www.flabber.nl)/[VolkomenKut](http://www.volkomenkut.com) /[GeenStijl](http://www.geenstijl.nl)): naked women and funny movies 
  2. **[veerle.duoh.com](http://veerle.duoh.com): 101136 hits**  
    Veerle's Blog has the most referenced non-shock blog, with articles on web design and advanced CSS. I knew she was good, but not that she was this good. 
  3. **[demuynck.org](http://demuynck.org): 94689 hits**  
    Wouter is the creator of the [Nucleus blog software](http://nucleuscms.org/) and has an original visual linkblog called &#8216;Karma Universe'. 
  4. **[lvb.net](http://lvb.net): 72984 hits**  
    Luc Van Braekel, a high profile blogger, is regularly featured in major media 
  5. **[www.polskaya.be](http://www.polskaya.be): 58162 hits**  
    If you thought all bloggers liked each other, this blog will prove you wrong.

So, this was the first test. I think I'm gonna do a second trial next week. Your suggestions, additions, corrections are welcome at peter.forret \_at\_ gmail.com. If you, like me, think this could be a nice upgrade to [Blogium](http://www.blogium.be), leave a note on this blog. If there's enough interest, I think Luc could be convinced.
