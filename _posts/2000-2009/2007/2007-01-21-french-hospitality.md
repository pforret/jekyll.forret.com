**French hospitality #1**

I've just spent a great weekend with the family in France. A couple from Antwerp has restored a 'gentilhommière' (small castle) in [Le Thurel](http://www.lethurel.com/) (Picardie) as a _gite d'etappe_ and turned it into a pleasant bed-and-breakfast!

Long walks on the beach, excellent food and abundance of wine. Splendid!  

  
**French hospitality #2**  
Returning home was less pleasant, however. After less than a km, we were stopped by two gendarmes on bikes for a presumed ignoring of a 'stop' sign. 
They gleefully treated as a bunch of _petits Belges_ (“_I don't know how it works in Belgium, but in this country we have to obey the law_“). 
They escorted us to the cash machine so that we could take out 90 euros. 
They might call it 'upholding the law' but it sure felt like a highway robbery.  
I didn't even argue. When you put an asshole in a uniform, he becomes an asshole that's always right, as I've learned contesting a fine for _honking my horn_ five years ago (funny detail: it wasn't me who honked, but good luck trying to prove that).
