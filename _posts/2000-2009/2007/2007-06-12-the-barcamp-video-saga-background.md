I've had a number of requests from attendees of the [Barcamp Brussels 3](http://barcamp.forret.com/) event. &#8220;_The speeches were recorded on Nokia N95 phones, right? How come we haven't seen them yet on Youtube/Google? What's taking so long?_&#8221; Well, here's the answer.

The reason is purely me. I received the N95 video's (3DVDs, about 12GB in total) from [Fré](http://www.druppels.be) quite soon after the event. At the time, I was &#8216;just going to throw them' on Google Video, maybe with a title image before the movie that included a Barcamp and Nokia logo. How hard would that be, right? Well, slightly harder than I thought. The files were huge, so had to be transcoded to something smaller, there were too many files to do things manually, so I needed to start scripting, and the tools I used for it, [ImageMagick](http://www.imagemagick.org) and [FFMPEG](http://ffmpeg.mplayerhq.hu/) are powerful but tricky. That combined with my tango activities, a holiday, a girlfriend abroad and the non-negligeable fact of having a day-time job made for this delay of over a month. Mea culpa. But the wait is over.

These are the first videos. Feedback on video, sound and other details are welcome! I will then proceed with the conversion of the other ones. I will also do a post on what tricks I used to do the video rendering of the title, the transcoding and the merging of video files.
