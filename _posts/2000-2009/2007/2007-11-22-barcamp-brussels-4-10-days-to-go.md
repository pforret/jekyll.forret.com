Barcamp Brussels #4 is coming closer: [Saturday Dec 1st](http://www.barcamp.be/blog/2007/11/08/barcamp-4-dec-1-at-mvillage/) is 10 days away. Our main sponsor is MSN/Windows Live.

If you're not already on [the attendee list](http://barcampbrussels.wikispaces.com/BarcampBrussels4) (we're around 70 now), please hurry, we have to close that list on Monday to fix the right quantities for catering.

Some last remarks:

  * As usual, we start at 9AM, we stop at 6PM. 
  * Parking is no problem, we can use the mVillage parking that's empty anyway, since it's a Saturday. 
  * Who wants to record videos? Out of experience I can only say I cannot do it myself, nor can I make them ready afterwards for Youtube/GVideo. So I need 3-5 people taking care of that.
  * Anyone doing anything with photography, like the previous time?
