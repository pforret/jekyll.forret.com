Bloggers love lists. Bloggers adore lists of bloggers, certainly when they're featured in the said lists. I started making top [30](/2005/02/popular-belgian-blogs-version-4/) and [60](/2005/10/wealthy-belgian-bloggers-the-blog-dollars-top-60/) lists of Belgian bloggers a way back, and [somewhere in Nov 2005](/2005/11/wealthy-belgian-bloggers-v3/) [Bruno](http://bvlg.blogspot.com) took over the position as ranking specialist. He has just finished making a new list based on Pagerank, Technorati backlinks, Bloglines subscribers and [some other indicators](http://bvlg.blogspot.com/2007/03/vlaamse-blogpersoonlijkheden.html). I came out #3, which proves that the bribe worked as expected.

Let's take a look at only 2 of those indicators for the top 20: Pagerank and Technorati backlinks (using the [Pagerank checker](http://web.forret.com/tools/pagerank.asp))

Two surprises jump out: 

  * the good position of [U2U'er Patrick](http://www.u2u.info/blogs/patrick/) (#11) which must be deserved through some other indicator, because a PR of 0 and 24 backlinks aren't _to write home about_ ([*](http://you-are-self-a-blog-you.blogspot.com/))
  * the low position of Flanders' premier shockblog (and provider of premium bootie) [Zattevrienden](http://www.zattevrienden.be/) (#13). They go through all that effort collecting pictures of crashing bikers and naked blondes, frame those delicately in contemporary culture through intelligent conversation, but are not sufficiently rewarded for it. Oh well &#8230;
