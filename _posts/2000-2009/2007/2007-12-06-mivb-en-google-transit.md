Wouldn't this be a great idea: the Brussels public transport not mapped by [MIVB](http://www.mivb.be/)&#8216;s horribly unpractical route planner, but by [Google's Transit](http://code.google.com/transit/spec/transit_feed_specification.html) maps. You just need to get an export of the stops, the routes and the times, and they can be shown on Google Maps just like that. Where should we start looking for the source data? Then create `agency.txt, stops.txt, routes.txt, trips.txt, stop_times.txt, calendar.txt` and that's it.
