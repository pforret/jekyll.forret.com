### EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

> Barcamp Brussels is a [free conference](/2006/04/barcamp-brussels-may-20-2006/) where [all attendees must also contribute](/2006/03/barcamp-brussels-may-2006/). Topics concern the influence of technology upon daily life. All attendees should list their names [here](http://barcamp.org/BarCampBrusselsForTheImpatient). A (non-exhaustive) list of topics is constructed [here](http://wiki.forret.com/index.php?title=BarcampTopics).

### SPEAKING

  * speaking slots will be 30 minutes each. So a presentation should last between 20-25 minutes. We'll probably start around 10h till 12h and again from 14h to 18h. (10 slots per room)
  * speaking style can be: regular presentation (Powerpoint/Keynote style), demo (on-line or off-line), moderated discussion (topic is suggested and crowd can join in)
  * everyone should do a presentation, help with someone else's presentation, do a audio/video podcast of presentations or participate in some other way
  * you do not have to be the world's authority to speak about something. It can be an unusual hobby, an positive experience or just a crazy idea. If you don't like to talk, do something with videos (&#8220;Computers in 20 years of Hollywood movies&#8221;), music (&#8220;Feminism in the MTV era&#8221;) or images (&#8220;Famous newspaper images you thought were real&#8221;).

**TOPICS**

  * I suggest the following &#8216;tracks': [Geeky / CMS / Blogosphere / Photography / Audio / Video / Marketing track](http://wiki.forret.com/index.php?title=BarcampTopics). You can already list the topic of your presentation(s) on the [wiki page](http://wiki.forret.com/index.php?title=BarcampTopics).
  * Just at the risk of repeating myself: **not all topics are technical**. No one will validate your CSS when you come in, or ask you to explain Einstein's relativity theory. If, however, you have no experience with email and have never heard of &#8216;Google', this day might be of little interest to you.
  * You will be able to indicate your presentation on a whiteboard when you arrive. If you want to have a good spot, come early.
  * Topics I would like to see presented: making music with Ableton Live/Garageband &#8211; blind surfing: accessibility check-up encoding video for the iPod/PSP &#8211; original viral campaigns &#8211; statistics/history of Belgian blogosphere &#8211; Photoshop demo &#8211; theory and practice of the RAW image format &#8211; the 20 memes you should know about &#8211; psychology of the blogger &#8211; remake Cinebel/IMDB site with RubyOnRails in 15 minutes &#8211; podcast legislation in Belgium and Europe &#8230;  
    There's plenty of interesting stuff we all know too little about. Join in, show us what stuff is going on in your mind and surprise us!
