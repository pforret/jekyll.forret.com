> We have just decided on the location and date for the new [Barcamp Brussels](http://barcamp.forret.com):
> 
> WHEN: **Sunday Sept 24th** 2006 (back to back with EurOSCON, GovCamp and DrupalCON)  
> WHERE: **[Skynet Lounge](http://www.skynetlounge.be)**, in K-NAL building next to Brussels harbour 
> 
> As you can guess from the location, [Skynet](http://www.skynet.be/) has been confirmed as the principal sponsor again (thx [Bart](http://becks.skynetblogs.be/) and [Clo](http://www.bnox.be/)), which allows us to provide a nice and stimulating surrounding for our speakers/attendees.
