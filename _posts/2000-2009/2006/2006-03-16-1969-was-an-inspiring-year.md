Russell Lichter writes the [Monthly Mix Challenge](http://russlichter.com/mix/mixblogger.html) blog: interesting monthly lists of songs on particular themes: e.g. titles [with the word &#8216;hate' in them](http://russlichter.com/mix/2006/03/mix-13-hate-songs.html) or [female drummers](http://russlichter.com/mix/2005/03/mix-1-female-drummers.html) (that I [mentioned earlier](/2005/04/26/my-favourite-drummers/)). 

At the end of last year he listed songs with a title that contains a year (number). And it appears my birth year was most inspiring:

> 2. “Born in ‘69” Rocket From the Crypt (1995)  
> &#8230;  
> 7. “Death Valley ‘69” Sonic Youth (1985)  
> &#8230;  
> 13. “69 Année Erotique” Serge Gainsbourg (1969)  
> &#8230;  
> 19. “1969” The Stooges (1969)  
> from [russlichter.com](http://russlichter.com/mix/2005/12/mix-11-title-of-year.html) 

That is, without even counting Brian Adams' &#8220;Summer of '69&#8221;, The Vines' &#8220;1969&#8221; or The Sisters Of Mercy's &#8220;1969&#8221;.  
However, I'm not sure whether Fat Boy Slim's &#8220;Star 69&#8221; was actually about the year.
