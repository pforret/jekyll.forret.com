Based on the excellent experience of last year's [Les Blogs](/2005/12/two-days-at-lesblogs-paris/), I just registered for the conference &#8220;[Le Web 3](http://www.leweb3.com)&#8221; in Paris on Dec 11th and 12th, organised by [SixApart/Vox](http://www.vox.com/go/loiclemeur).

[Clo](http://www.bnox.be) and me are the first two Belgians on the [attendee list](http://www.leweb3.com/leweb3/2006/10/participants_li.html), but I'm sure we will be joined by a bigger Belgian crowd soon. If you're interested in hearing some high-level speakers and mingle with a bunch of web entrepreneurs and enthusiasts, don't hesitate: if you register before Nov 11th, the price is &euro; 300 instead of &euro; 500. I'm sure [Loic](http://www.loiclemeur.com/) will make this edition even better than the previous (like: bigger food, more parties).
