Like M.A.R.R.S. said: &#8220;_Countdown is progressive_&#8220;. Ten days from now we'll be frantically preparing the International Press Center for [Barcamp Brussels](http://wiki.forret.com/index.php?title=BarcampBrussels). This is the progress report:

  * We have found some very helpful sponsors (including [Skynet](http://www.skynet.be)) to help us with catering and equipment.
  * Everything will be recorded and made available afterwards. [Ine](http://www.monuments.nu) will be coordinating the [audio/video podcast](http://wiki.forret.com/index.php?title=BarcampMedia) efforts.
  * We have just jumped above 40 attendees on [the Barcamp attendee list](http://barcamp.org/BarCampBrusselsForTheImpatient). Fifty would be an even nicer number. If you still know other people that could be interested to attend, just ask them! (more details on the concept [here](/2006/04/barcamp-brussels-less-than-a-month-to-go/)!)
