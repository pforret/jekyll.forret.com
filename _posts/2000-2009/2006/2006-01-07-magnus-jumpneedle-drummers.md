I was checking out the [Deus](http://www.deus.be) website to see if their new video for the [Pocket Revolution album](http://www.deus.be/index.php?action=loadmusic&section=albums&ReleaseID=36) was already online (a friend of mine, Sachli, is playing in it with four other cute girls).  
There was a link to another Tom Barman project, [Magnus](http://www.magnusmusic.com/), and I remembered being an &#8216;extra' in one of the music videos Tom directed for &#8220;Jumpneedle&#8221;. The official Magnus site only has a 1-minute excerpt, but I did find a full version on [anti.com](http://www.anti.com/artist.php?id=18). So where am I?

I'm the one on the right, with the blue drumkit.

### La petite histoire

Tom Barman had asked on [Studio Brussel](http://www.stubru.be) that he was looking for 40 drummers for a music video, and I called in to say I would be there. I also invited [Teun Verbruggen](http://www.jazzinbelgium.com/musician/teun.verbruggen), who I knew through [Muzikant-zoekt-muzikant](http://www.vca.be), and we spent half a day in Antwerp shooting the 5 seconds of video with 38 other drummers. (Check [the video](http://www.anti.com/download.php?id=150) around 2:45)

### The video

The whole video is about a dream of a guy entering a sleazy motel and doing some kinky stuff with women in underwear (now there's an unusual dream) and features [Tom Barman](http://www.tombarman.com/) himself, [CJ Bolland](http://www.cjbolland.com/), [Mauro Pawlowski](http://www.mauroworld.com/), [Kim Peers](http://models.com/model_culture/tales_model/kim_peers/p1.html), [Zohra](http://www.zohra.be/), [Tim Van Hamel](http://www.millionaire-theband.com/) en [Peter Vermeersch](http://www.jazzinbelgium.com/musician/peter.vermeersch).
