I saw a gig some weeks ago by [Moodlex](https://www.last.fm/music/Moodlex): just one guy with a portable PC, mixing his music live.  
It was awesome, terribly funky. 
I just had to know what he was using for software, that made it so easy and intuitive to do live mixing/composing.  
I think there &#8216;s a fair chance he was using [Ableton Live](http://www.ableton.com/). 
I've downloaded the trial version and hope to test it out soon on my new DAW system.

Oh yeah, I also saw Briskey there, a group similar to Sven van Hees, but not that good. 
Only, their female jazz drummer, Isolde Lasoen, she's great &#8211; in more than one aspect. 
I hope to see her again with the band Skeemz on the [Brussels Jazz Marathon](http://www.brusselsjazzmarathon.be). 
She's the girl on the sofa in the back on their first video, but you have to see her drumming to fully appreciate.
