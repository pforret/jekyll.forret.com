A friend told me about an off-the-record list of celebrities with unpleasant body odor, where Brad Pitt supposedly featured as #3. Some Googling later, I found out Brad has moved up to #1! Here is the list as compiled in May 2004 by Mikael Jagerbrand:  


## 1. Brad Pitt

I remember a Friends episode [&#8220;The one with the rumour&#8221;](http://homepage.ntlworld.com/steven.whittingslow/series8-episode9.htm) where Brad Pitt did a guest appearance. Brad and Courtney on the same set, what an olfactory delight.
