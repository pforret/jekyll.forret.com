Geeky as hell, but I need it quite often, and what better place to put it but here: the list of 250+ HTML character entities.  
Handy if you would want to write **&sigma; = &frac34; &bull; &sum; &fnof;(&chi;&sup2;)** &#8211; or your name like **"&pi;&epsilon;&tau;&epsilon;&rho;"**

_UPDATE_: now an even more complete overview can be found on [Online Character map](https://toolstud.io/web/charmap.php). Convert your own text to HTML-encoded with [HTML encode](https://toolstud.io/web/htmlencode.php).
