I remember that before I started photography on a serious level, I had some understanding of shutter speed, but none of aperture and focal length. Even when I read what they meant, I still couldn&#8217;t &#8216;picture&#8217; it, had no feeling for the numbers. Let&#8217;s leave &#8216;aperture&#8217; for another time and just concentrate for now on the concept of &#8220;**focal length&#8221;**

First of all, the focal length of a lens is not the same as the actual physical length of the lens. Yes, 200mm and 300mm lenses (telephoto lenses) tend to be longer, but they&#8217;re not exactly 200mm and 300mm long. For instance, the Sigma 55-200mm F4-5.6 DC HSM is 85mm (3.3&#8243;) long,  while the 70-200mm F2.8 II EX DG lens is 184mm (7.2&#8243;). Same maximal focal length, but more than twice as long.

So what is [focal length](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focal_length)? I could explain that it is &#8220;_the distance from the center of the lens to the principal foci (or focal points) of the lens_&#8220;, but that wouldn&#8217;t make it more comprehensible, would it? Well, I read through the theory, with tangens of the viewing angle and stuff, and I think I understand it (I&#8217;m an engineer, I actually like trigoniometry). A 200mm lens gives a viewing angle of 12° on the diagonal. Still not clear? That&#8217;s when I thought: let&#8217;s invent something more tangible: the &#8220;_portrait distance_&#8220;. Say you need a surface of about **72cm x 48cm** **(28&#8243; x 18&#8243;)** to make a portrait of a person (not just a headshot, but with some torso on it too). See some examples below:

Well, **the distance between the camera and the person you&#8217;re making the portrait of, will be +- <big>20 times the focal length</big>**.

<!--more-->

For a digital full frame camera (like the Canon 5D or the Nikon D700) this goes as follows:

  * a 50mm &#8216;portrait&#8217; lens => you need +- 20 x 50mm or 1 meter to make a portrait.

For a cheaper dSLR camera like the Canon 50D, Nikon D90 or lower, you need to take into account the [crop factor of 1.6](http://digital-photography-school.com/crop-factor-explained):

  * a 50mm &#8216;portrait&#8217; lens is equivalent to a 80mm => you need +- 20 x 80mm or 1.6 meter to make a portrait.

This is not a law, but a rough approximation, a &#8216;[heuristic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heuristic)&#8216;. When you go closer, you still have a portrait, but the face will cover more than  a quarter of the surface. If you go further away, you get more of the body in the shot. But if you go shopping for lenses, certainly when you&#8217;re a photographer of people, it can be nice to keep this in mind.

And this scales linearly, so say you need 2,5 times that height: 180cm x 120 cm because 1,80cm is the average height of a person: you will find this at 20 x 2,5 = 50 times the focal distance.

**Person distance: in order to fit a person in the picture when you hold the camera in upright (&#8216;portrait&#8217;) position, you need _50 times the focal distance_.**

20 for a portrait, 50 for a person. So if you&#8217;re a paparazzo with a Canon 1D MkIV, and you want to shoot a couple kissing at 120 meters/130 yards? You need a 12000 mm/20 = 600mm lens. 5600 grams and even more euros, but you&#8217;ll get that kiss!
