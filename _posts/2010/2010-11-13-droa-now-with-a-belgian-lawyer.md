It seems my contacts with the people from Domain Registry of America (DROA) have gone one legal step up. Last week I have received an official letter from a Brussels law office, representing the Domain Registry of America &#8211; DROA (Buffalo, NY, USA), Domain Registry of Canada &#8211; DROC (Markham, Ontario, Canada), Domain Renewal Group (London UK) and Mr Alan Benlolo. Apparently my claims about the &#8220;domain renewal scam&#8221;, as most legit domain registrars and thousands of fooled users call it, are &#8220;_completely unfunded_&#8221; and constitute &#8220;_defamation and libel_&#8221; (Article 443 &#8211; translated from Dutch by me).

Furthermore they claim that

  * I supposedly have published the home address of Mr Benlolo on my blog. I have checked and in none of my blog posts about the DROA ([DROA scam](http://blog.forret.com/2004/12/domain-registry-of-america-scam/), [Govern yourselves accordingly](http://blog.forret.com/2007/03/govern-yourselves-accordingly/) and [DROA: the saga continues](http://blog.forret.com/2010/09/droa-the-saga-continues/)) have I published any address belonging to a person: all addresses are PO Boxes &#8211; so not physical addresses &#8211; belonging to companies, not persons. These addresses I have found either on the letters what were sent by the DROA or on their web site.  
    The letter I received actually shows Mr Benlolo&#8217;s address, and I can confirm it is nowhere on my blog. Other unhappy customers might have done that on other blogs/forums, but not me.
  * I am supposed to remove the three blog posts mentioned above ASAP. I have reread all three and in each I just cite known convictions of persons and companies involved, as well as reactions from institutions like the  FTC and Better Business Bureaus who all disapprove of the type of business that the DROA is active in.
  * Interestingly I&#8217;m also supposed to remove a fourth blog post &#8220;[Amy Cross is spamming Technorati](http://blog.forret.com/2005/07/amy-cross-spamming-technorati/)&#8221; which I did not know was related. Maybe it&#8217;s just because there&#8217;s a link to the DROA article.

I have gotten seven days to comply, and that period has just expired. I have tried to contact the lawyers but no one has bothered to call me back. I don&#8217;t agree with their claims, and I still stand by the blog posts I have written.
