And talking about blogging is something I will do a lot in the near future:

  * I&#8217;m going to [Shoob](http://www.shoob.com)&#8216;s [Blogging conference](http://2pointzero.shoob.com/) in Brussels on Oct 6th
  * with [Bart](http://webguide.fgov.be/) I&#8217;m organising the [Brussels Bloggers Dinner](http://bloggers.smoothouse.com/) on Oct 7th
  * I just registered for [Loic](http://www.loiclemeur.com/)&#8216;s [LesBlogs 2.0 conference](http://lesblogs.typepad.com/) in Paris on Dec 5th/6th.

Anyone has an interesting conference in Rome or Madrid coming up? We&#8217;re running out of Indian summer here.
