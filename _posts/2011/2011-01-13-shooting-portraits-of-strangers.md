This was quite a discovery: **Danny Santos** has been shooting portraits of complete strangers on Orchard Road, Singapore. The story was featured on [JPG Magazine](http://jpgmag.com/stories/17156) with some beautiful examples and that post pointed to his [Facebook album](http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=23371&id=129058543774460), which pointed to his [blog post](http://www.dannyst.com/shooting-portraits-of-strangers/) about it. This phrase he wrote made me think: &#8220;_Suddenly, strangers were no longer unwitting <del datetime="2010-12-12T02:52:04+00:00">victims</del> subjects, they were now willing participants … and that gave different life to the photograph, and a new awareness and dimension to my idea of shooting in the streets_.&#8221; Touches a weak point of mine: asking strangers for permission to photograph them.

What I like a lot about the photographs is their shallow depth-of-field. He talks about his material: a Nikon D300 with a 85mm f/1.4 lens. That&#8217;s a $999 lens, so one can expect some good results.

Let&#8217;s see what that looks like in my toolstud.io [depth-of-field calculator](https://toolstud.io/photo/dof.php): there is one picture on his blog that shows him taking a picture of someone at +- 2m away, so let&#8217;s use that as distance. If we fill in the right values ([1.5 crop factor for a Nikon D300, f/1.4 aperture, 85mm focal length, 2m distance, 3:2 aspec](https://toolstud.io/photo/dof.php?cropfactor=1.5&focallengthmm=85&aperturef=1.4&distancem=2)t ratio) we get this:

<!--more-->Only 2.8 cm of sharpness, that&#8217;s shallow! You see it in the background of the pictures: hardly anything recognizable, but a nice creamy _bokeh_. Take a look at this picture: her eyes and mouth are in focus, but the hairs that cover her ears are already a bit blurred. The background is white and green, but it&#8217;s hard to say what exactly.

I found it a very inspiring project with admirable results. Check out all his [photos on Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/dannysantos/sets/72157622966228004/)!
