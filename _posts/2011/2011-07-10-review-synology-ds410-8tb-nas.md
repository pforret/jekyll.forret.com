Last year my 4TB Lacie drive died. It&#8217;s a good thing I&#8217;m paranoid about data storage and I had 2 copies of my photo archive (now about 1.4 TB) elsewhere. Although my Lacie drive had &#8216;protected&#8217; storage, after repair it came back reformatted. I decided to never buy Lacie anymore &#8211; I have had a 1TB, 2TB and a 4TB drive and they have all broken down at some point. My next storage solution would be a stand-alone NAS with 4 disks!

After reading some reviews on QNAP and Synology, I decided on the [Synology DS410](http://www.synology.com/products/product.php?product_name=DS410&lang=enu). I ordered it at [Memoryshop](http://www.memoryshop.be/product/105185/synology-ds410.html) for a decent price and some days later it was shipped to me together with 4 Samsung 2TB drives. Installation is swift and uneventful. I configured it as one big 6TB RAID-5 volume and started copying all my pictures, music and movies. The device comes with the shares /music, /video and /pictures preconfigured, and copying to these folders makes sense, because then the music appears in the handy iTunes server, and all media shows up in the DLNA Media Server.

The advantage of a Linux-powered NAS is that it comes with a number of easy-to-install applications (Torrent Client, MySQL, LAMP stack web server) and you can even install, through [ipkg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ipkg), lots of standard Linux packages. On the QNAP server at the office, I have file sync tasks running at regular intervals and it works flawlessly.

If you&#8217;re serious about your storage (because you need it for your work), don&#8217;t be content with just an external USB drive. Invest a bit more to have a NAS you can trust. And also: never trust it 100%. I now have +- 16TB of storage at home so that I have multiple copies of everything and I also use Mozy cloud storage for my exported pictures (&#8216;only&#8217; 12 GB for the moment).
