I store quite a lot of info in Google Spreadsheets, for the obvious reasons:

  * anyone can edit from any place, even at the same time
  * the servers are more reliable than a server at the office
  * I can use the info (with CSV/Excel export) in other programs through a web link

But there is a problem popping up at random moments with that last export or &#8216;publish&#8217; functionality. Sometimes when you download the published link of a CSV export (through [curl](http://curl.haxx.se/)), you get an error &#8216;_Moved Temporarily &#8211;Â The document has moved_&#8216; with a redirect to a www.google.com address. And if you don&#8217;t follow HTTP 302 redirects, you can&#8217;t get to the actual content. In the past I&#8217;ve always worked around it or waited until the error went away, but today I searched a bit further. So for [those](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1646073/not-able-to-access-google-spreadsheet-from-app-engine-moved-temporarily) [who](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5834821/read-csv-fails-to-read-a-csv-file-from-google-docs) [have](http://www.mail-archive.com/google-docs-data-apis@googlegroups.com/msg01998.html) the same question: read and learn!

The redirect is actually for authentication. Although I publish without requiring signing in, so one would expect no authentication process, there actually is one. See what it does (I used _wget_ in verbose mode to get the HTTP headers):

<pre  ><code>>:~$ wget -v "https://spreadsheets.google.com/(...)&output=csv"
-- https://spreadsheets.google.com/(...)&output=csv
(...)
Location: https://www.google.com/... (first redirect)
-- https://www.google.com/(...)/ServiceLogin?=...
(...)
Location: https://spreadsheets.google.com/... (second redirect)
-- https://spreadsheets.google.com/(...)&output=csv&ndplr=1
(...)
Saving to: ...</code></pre>

So what is the solution: just add &#8220;**&ndplr=1**&#8221; to your URL and you will skip the authentication redirect. I&#8217;m not sure what the NDPLR parameter name stands for, let&#8217;s just call it: &#8220;**Never Do Published Link Redirection**&#8220;.
