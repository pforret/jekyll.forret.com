Just in case you forgot: less than a dozen days to go before the smoking ban in Belgian restaurants. What was only possible in places like the [AB resto](http://blog.forret.com/2006/02/ancienne-belgique-rocks/) or [Bar Bik](http://brussel.blogt.be/2006/09/27/rookvrij-lunch.html#comment-2833), will then be the norm: no one spoiling your food with cigarette smoke!
