At the Pixagogo reunion dinner the other evening, I was reminded by one of my ex-colleagues Steven (&#8216;[Beukie](http://www.flickr.com/photos/beukie)&#8216;) that back in 2003 I was having some fun with remixes/mashups. More specifically, I took some vocals of the Belgian &#8220;Idool 2003&#8221; preselections, and added music to them. To make the exercise more fun, I took samples from the ones that were really musically challenged.

So I went back in my archives and here are the three that I found:

* "I will you in the night" - Marnik had translated a Flemish song, into his own "impoverisation", as he proudly announces. Unfortunately, the Dutch "Ik wil je" (I want you) does not normally translate into the English "I will you".  
  
    I also found back the original clip on Youtube (via [partybrigade](https://thepartybrigade.blogspot.com/2009/02/i-will-you-in-night.html)):  
    
* "But if I let you go" - This 'Pieter' was officially called the worst candidate by the jury, and that decision is not impossible to understand. He had no tone, no rhythm and bad English. "There snow one like you" He needed a lot of input of Madonna to make it bearable.  
    
* "Killing me softly" - She was not that bad a singer, but her timing was awful. I remember having to cut and trim a lot to align her words to a steady beat. I made it a slow jazzy version with a lot of echo.  
    

Out of that [edition of Idool](http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idool_2003) came Hadise, Brahim and Natalia, so it wasn't all that bad. Still, there was also the girl with the wobbly hands.
