In 2007 I wrote a post "[Learning Bulgarian in an Hour](/2007/11/09/learning-bulgarian-in-an-hour/)" based on this article: [How to Learn (But Not Master) Any Language in 1 Hour](https://tim.blog/2007/11/07/how-to-learn-but-not-master-any-language-in-1-hour-plus-a-favor/). Let's see how that works out with [Hungarian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_language).

## Introduction

> Disclaimer: my wife is Hungarian, I have had a lot of exposure to it, and somehow almost none of it stuck with me. 
> I'm normally not that bad with languages. So it's their fault, not mine. Will I get chewed out for this article? Probably.

"_Isn't Hungarian, like, a slavic language?_" (I get this question every now and then). Oh my, do I have news for you. Hungarian is a language isolate, meaning it has **no known relatives**. It is not related to any other language in Europe, and is one of the few languages in the world that is not part of the Indo-European family. It is spoken by about 10 million people in Hungary and by an additional 3 million people in other countries, including Romania, Slovakia, Ukraine, Serbia, Croatia, and Austria.

Hungarians have been using the roman alphabet since 1000AD, before that it was written in [rovásírás - Hungarian runes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Hungarian_script) . Their alphabet is 44 characters, 14 of which are vowels. That sounds like a lot, but part of it is that they strive for a phonetic language. E.g. if the 'o' in "pot" sounds different from the 'o' in "boot", then it should be written differently. They're very peculiar about their 's' sounds: there's s, sz, zs, cs and dzs.

## Difficulty

Hungarian prides itself in being one of the most difficult languages on the continent. The Polish might disagree, but then, don't they always. Let's see how it scores on the 4 criteria:

1. _Are there new grammatical structures that will postpone fluency? (look at Subject-Object-Verb vs. Subject-Verb-Object, as well as noun cases)_  
   There is no classical SOV or SVO. The Verb often leads (let's call it VSO), the object gets suffixes to indicate position, direction or possession. Most importantly, there is no gender. "His car/Her car", "to him/to her", it's all the same.
2. _Are there new sounds that will double or quadruple time to fluency? (especially vowels)_  
   It is written phonetically, but not in the same way a german or roman language speaker would use the language. E.g. 's' is pronounced 'sh' like in 'shaman', while 'sz' is the sound that we normally associate with s.
3. _How similar is it to languages I already understand? What will help and what will interfere? (Will acquisition erase a previous language? Can I borrow structures without fatal interference like Portuguese after Spanish?)_  
   You're on your own here. It's not related to any other language in Europe. They had a joint empire with the Austrians for a while, yet [almost no German words](https://hu.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=Kategória%3Ahu%3ANémet_eredetű_szavak&pageuntil=kappan#mw-pages) were adopted into the language.
4. _All of which answer: How difficult will it be, and how long would it take to become functionally fluent?_  
   I'm going to say: [at least 10.000 hours](https://www.newyorker.com/sports/sporting-scene/complexity-and-the-ten-thousand-hour-rule).

## Language structure

Let's take these 9 sentences that clarify a lot about how the language works:

| English                   | Hungarian                       |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------|
| The apple is red          | _A alma piros_                  |
| It is John’s apple        | _Ez János alma_                 |
| I give John the apple     | _Odaadom Johnnak az almát_      |
| We give him the apple     | _Adjuk neki az almát_           |
| He gives it to John       | _Johnnak adja_                  |
| She gives it to him       | _Odaadja neki_                  |
| I must give it to him     | _Oda kell adnom neki_           |
| I want to give it to her  | _Oda akarom adni neki_          |
| I give John the red apple | _Odaadom Johnnak a piros almát_ |

## Helping verbs

And the verbs for easy auxiliary usage are:

| English                   | Hungarian                       |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------|
| I want, you want          | _akarok, akarsz_                |
| I can, you can            | _tudok, tudsz_                  |
| I have to, you have to    | _kell, kell_                    |
| I love to, you love to    | _szeretek, szeretsz_            |
| I must, you must          | _muszáj, muszáj_                |
| I should, you should      | _kéne, kéne_                    |
| I will, you will          | _fogok, fogsz_                  |
| I would, you would        | _akarnék, akarnál_              |


## Sounds and scripts

Hungarian uses ⟨s⟩ for /ʃ/ and ⟨sz⟩ for /s/, which is the reverse of Polish usage. The letter ⟨zs⟩ is /ʒ/ and ⟨cs⟩ is /t͡ʃ/. The letter ⟨c⟩ is pronounced /t͡s/ before ⟨e⟩ and ⟨i⟩, and /k/ elsewhere. <span style="font-size: .9em">The letter ⟨y⟩ is used only in foreign words, and is pronounced /i/ or /j/ depending on context. The letter ⟨z⟩ is pronounced /z/ before ⟨a⟩, ⟨á⟩, ⟨o⟩, ⟨ó⟩, ⟨u⟩, ⟨ú⟩, and /s/ elsewhere. The letter ⟨r⟩ is pronounced /r/ before ⟨a⟩, ⟨á⟩, ⟨o⟩, ⟨ó⟩, ⟨u⟩, ⟨ú⟩, and /ɾ/ elsewhere. </span><span style="font-size: .8em">The letter ⟨ny⟩ is pronounced /ɲ/ and ⟨ly⟩ is pronounced /j/ before ⟨e⟩ and ⟨i⟩, and /ɲ/ elsewhere. The letter ⟨gy⟩ is pronounced /ɟ/ before ⟨e⟩ and ⟨i⟩, and /ɡ/ elsewhere. </span><span style="font-size: .7em">The letter ⟨h⟩ is pronounced /h/ before ⟨a⟩, ⟨á⟩, ⟨o⟩, ⟨ó⟩, ⟨u⟩, ⟨ú⟩, and /ɦ/ elsewhere. The letter ⟨v⟩ is pronounced /v/ before ⟨a⟩, ⟨á⟩, ⟨o⟩, ⟨ó⟩, ⟨u⟩, ⟨ú⟩, and /f/ elsewhere. </span><span style="font-size: .6em">The letter ⟨j⟩ is pronounced /j/ before ⟨a⟩, ⟨á⟩, ⟨o⟩, ⟨ó⟩, ⟨u⟩, ⟨ú⟩, and /j/ elsewhere. The letter ⟨l⟩ is pronounced /l/ before ⟨a⟩, ⟨á⟩, ⟨o⟩, ⟨ó⟩, ⟨u⟩, ⟨ú⟩, and /w/ elsewhere.</span><span style="font-size: .5em"> The letter ⟨í⟩ is pronounced /iː/ and ⟨e⟩ is pronounced /ɛ/ before ⟨r⟩, ⟨l⟩, ⟨j⟩, ⟨v⟩, ⟨z⟩, ⟨s⟩, ⟨sz⟩, ⟨zs⟩, ⟨c⟩, ⟨cs⟩, ⟨dz⟩, ⟨dzs⟩, ⟨ty⟩, ⟨gy⟩, ⟨ny⟩, ⟨ly⟩, ⟨h⟩, ⟨n⟩, ⟨m⟩, ⟨p⟩, ⟨b⟩, ⟨f⟩, ⟨g⟩, ⟨k⟩, ⟨t⟩, ⟨d⟩, ⟨r⟩, ⟨l⟩</span>

You still there?

## Conclusion

What this tells me, is that it would be interesting to build a language evaluator for all languages, that would use a **limited number of key sentences** to deduce usage of gender, plurals, suffixes, time, etc. and then give a score for the difficulty of the language.
