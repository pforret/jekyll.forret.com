I just spent a wonderful five days on a [tango course in Italy](http://www.tango-argentino.org/abanoterme_eng.html). Life at the [Abano Ritz](http://www.abanoritz.it/inglese/home.asp) (Abano Terme, near Venice) is quite enjoyable, and the teachers [Marisa & Oliver](http://www.marisayoliver.com/) and [Birkit & Muzaffer](http://www.tangolazapada.nl) were excellent. 

Since it was my first tango holiday abroad, I did learn quite a lot:

  * I&#8217;m not nearly as good in [milonga](http://tango.smoothouse.com/dance/Milonga) (the simple style you dance in the often crowded tango salons) as I want to be. Being able to do two [gancho](http://tango.smoothouse.com/dance/gancho)s one after the other with a nifty little adorno in between is nice, but I enjoyed the simple milonga lessons the most (variations on the [paso basico](http://tango.smoothouse.com/dance/Basico), &#8230;) 
  * As corny as &#8220;_Holistic Holiday dedicated to Argentine Tango, Friendship and the Joy of Living_&#8221; (cf [tango-argentino.org](http://www.tango-argentino.org/abanoterme_eng.html)) may sound, that was exactly was it was. The Italian food and drink, the hot water swimming pool, the sun, the foot massages, and that combined with tango dancing. Really a great way to spend a holiday. 
  *<img style="float: right" src="http://www.pixagogo.com/S5vpfnjbBPdPlCvid7b390cO6czXTj2jFS29bvFmpspo4!AMIiMqFtHjGKqNnzx7UPd3xe4oZmN8!YKenVSHMhsmrUYBooIsWYntV3qODCHtivlCmKPbX6P7!RUwq3ZK42VyzahLk71WHKeTN2qxDiOg__/tango_dance.jpg" /> There&#8217;s more music you can tango on than the traditional Buenos Aires [Gardel](http://www.todotango.com/english/gardel/default.asp) and [Piazzolla](http://www.todotango.com/english/creadores/apiazzolla.html) tunes: I of course knew [The Gotan Project](http://www.gotanproject.com/), but apparently I should also check out [Bajo Fondo Tango Club](http://www.bajofondotangoclub.com/bftc.html) and [Carlos Libedinsky](http://www.carloslibedinsky.com/) (via [tangonoticias.com](http://www.tangonoticias.com/tangotalk/viewtopic.php?topic=307&forum=7&start=15&29)). You can also dance to more western music like Grace Jones, Sting and Van Morrison (as can be found on [Neotango.com](http://www.neotango.com/neotangos.html)) 
  * Experienced tango dancers sure know their tango music: song titles, orchestra styles, voices of singers. The knowledge I gather while creating the [Tango Musica podcast](http://tango.smoothouse.com/music/) will come in handy. 
  * Life ain&#8217;t fair. Men&#8217;s tango shoes can have heels up to 35mm (1.38&#8243;). Girls can go up to 80mm (3.14&#8243;). Raise that chin! 
  * The prejudices about Italians are largely based on the truth. As a man, I of course have no experience with the [Italian macho seduction skills](http://americangirlsareeasy.com/book/italian_men.shtml), but both men and women seem to have a natural tendency towards careless arrogance.  
    > As far as geography goes, you can never know too much about Italy. If you meet an Italian in Japan and ask where he&#8217;s from, he won&#8217;t say he&#8217;s from Italy. Instead he&#8217;ll name some obscure Italian city, assuming you know the ins and outs of his country.
