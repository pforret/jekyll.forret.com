> When a user enters a music-related search in Google search box, the resulting search returns information about the artist, a few albums and a picture, when available, above the standard search results.

Let&#8217;s show you what that looks like.

### SERP with music results

One does a google.com search on &#8220;[Harry Connick Jr](http://www.google.com/search?q=harry+connick+jr)&#8221; (it works with &#8220;[Britney Spears](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2005/12/searching-for-music.html)&#8221; too):

### SERP focused on artist

When you click on the &#8220;Harry Connick Jr.&#8221; title, you go to a precompiled artist page on [www.google.com/musica](http://www.google.com/musica?aid=OJ2tE87ghKM&oi=musicr) that lists the albums of the artist (and where to buy them on iTunes, Amazon MSN &#8230;) , songs and &#8211; [the MPA will love this](http://blog.forret.com/blog/2005/12/mpa-and-other-peoples-money.html) &#8211; lyrics!! (e.g. &#8220;[It had to be you](http://www.google.com/musics?lid=xNzY247C-GI&aid=OJ2tE87ghKM&sid=UJw39KICUmC)&#8221; lists three sites that have the lyrics of this classic).

### SERP for music (artists/albums)

When you click on the &#8220;More music results for harry connick jr&#8221;, you go to [www.google.com/musicsearch](http://www.google.com/musicsearch?q=harry+connick+jr&oi=musict).  
Again, the albums, songs and artists that are most relevant for this search. Google even tracks on what albums a certain song is featured. Nice!

### Conclusion

A nice addition to the Google search capabilities, but nothing revolutionary.

Remark: this is only music search;, not audio search as [I talked about last year](http://blog.forret.com/blog/2004/10/google-is-listening-searching-audio.html).
