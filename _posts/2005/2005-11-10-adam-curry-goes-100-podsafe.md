Adam Curry, godfather of podcasting, has had an epiphany:

> I was told &#8211; maybe I should say &#8230; threatened is not the right word &#8211; but &#8216;promised&#8217; that they (the music/broadcasting companies) are gonna come after podcasters, and they&#8217;re gonna shut them down. What was implied, is that they were going to shut podcasting down.  
> (at 9:58 in [DSC-275-2005-11-07.mp3](http://mp3.dailysourcecode.podshow.com/DSC-275-2005-11-07.mp3))

So he did not take this &#8216;promise&#8217; lightly and got rid of all his licensed music.

> 11:10 Wondering why certain episodes of [DSC](http://www.dailysourcecode.com) are not in the archives? Adam has been contacted by several Dutch representatives of international music services tell him &#8220;hey, this file&#8217;s on your server, it&#8217;s licensed music, get it off there.&#8221; Adam has removed episodes with such songs on there. Adam has even &#8220;cleaned&#8221; his computers at home of every possible mp3, and now has only podsafe tunes on there. Adam will not play any non-podsafe song on the DSC. No more Mashups. If it&#8217;s not on [PMN](http://music.podshow.com/), it doesn&#8217;t get played.

Adam was actually in Brussels while doing that podcast, visiting some European Parliament contacts. He is concerned that the music industry could get a European directive passed, making sure that there will be no way for podcasters to play licensed music, no reasonable priced yearly/monthly license. Playing commercial music is only for the big boys.

So Adam&#8217;s reaction is: &#8220;Scr*w you, we&#8217;ll make you irrelevant&#8221;. Don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;ll work, but it&#8217;s a big step.

> Once they get to know new artists in the free-and-legal bag they aren&#8217;t reliant on music which can only be shared in the underground, but getting them over the hump is not so easy: they have to hang around long enough to absorb new sounds and stop being disappointed that they can&#8217;t have the old ones. With Adam and the many podcasters he influences on board, we have a good shot at breaking through.

I am still before that hump, I&#8217;m not ready yet to throw out all my RIAA/IFPI licensed music. There&#8217;s just to many memories linked to music I have.

Yet.
