> **Barry** (played by [Jack Black](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0085312/)): Rob, top five musical crimes perpetuated by Stevie Wonder in the '80s and '90s. Go. Sub-question: is it in fact unfair to criticize a formerly great artist for his latter day sins, is it better to burn out or fade away?  
> (from [imdb.com](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0146882/quotes))

My top 5 of Stevie's crimes in the 80's and 90's would be:

  1. I Just Called To Say I Love You ('84) 
  2. Ebony And Ivory ('82) 
  3. Part Time Lover ('85) 
  4. Jungle Fever ('91) 
  5. For Your Love ('95)

Be that as it may, I still consider him as a musical genius (and I'm not alone), and he's definitely in my top 5 of favourite artists. 
He's the one that came up with Master Blaster, Superstition, As, Sunshine of my life, Higher Ground, Sir Duke, &#8230; and I still forget loads of classics. 
I can still remember the goose bumps I got listening the first time to [Original Musiquarium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stevie_Wonder%27s_Original_Musiquarium_I). _"Dennis playing by himself, man!"_

So it made me very happy when I heard his new single: &#8220;[What The Fuss?](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0009IE75C/forretcom-21?creative=6394&camp=1406&link_code=as1)&#8221; and realise he's finally back. Back with a funky synth bass, kick ass drums and intelligent lyrics:

> Should I be drivin' thru a klantown,  
> find a restaurant to get me some food  
> And someone says &#8220;hey boy, we don't serve your kind&#8221;  
> Shame on them  
> And if we live in a democracy and  
> you don't use your power to vote  
> Knowin' some would like to turn back the hands of time  
> Shame on us  
> (from [genius.com](https://genius.com/Stevie-wonder-so-what-the-fuss-lyrics))

Looking forward to the new album, [A time to love](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00099IACC/forretcom-21/026-0636330-8732461?%5Fencoding=UTF8&camp=1634&link%5Fcode=xm2), out in July 2005!
