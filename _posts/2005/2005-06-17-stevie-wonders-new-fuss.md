> **Barry** (played by [Jack Black](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0085312/)): Rob, top five musical crimes perpetuated by Stevie Wonder in the &#8217;80s and &#8217;90s. Go. Sub-question: is it in fact unfair to criticize a formerly great artist for his latter day sins, is it better to burn out or fade away?  
> (from [imdb.com](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0146882/quotes))

My top 5 of Stevie&#8217;s crimes in the 80&#8217;s and 90&#8217;s would be:

  1. I Just Called To Say I Love You (&#8217;84) 
  2. Ebony And Ivory (&#8217;82) 
  3. Part Time Lover (&#8217;85) 
  4. Jungle Fever (&#8217;91) 
  5. For Your Love (&#8217;95)

Be that as it may, I still consider him as a musical genius (and [I&#8217;m not alone](http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/collective/A1132165)), and he's definitely in my top 5 of favourite artists. He's the one that came up with Master Blaster, Superstition, As, Sunshine of my life, Higher Ground, Sir Duke, &#8230; and I still forget loads of classics. I can still remember the goose bumps I got listening the first time to [Original Musiquarium](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000508WU/forretcom-21/026-0636330-8732461?%5Fencoding=UTF8&camp=1634&link%5Fcode=xm2). _&#8220;[Dennis](http://www.geocities.com/drummerinterviews/dennisdavis1.html "'Do I Do' - Dennis Davis on drums") playing by himself, man!&#8221;_

So it made me very happy when I heard his new single: &#8220;[What The Fuss?](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0009IE75C/forretcom-21?creative=6394&camp=1406&link_code=as1)&#8221; and realise he&#8217;s finally back. Back with a funky synth bass, kick ass drums and intelligent lyrics:

> Should I be drivin&#8217; thru a klantown,  
> find a restaurant to get me some food  
> And someone says &#8220;hey boy, we don&#8217;t serve your kind&#8221;  
> Shame on them  
> And if we live in a democracy and  
> you don&#8217;t use your power to vote  
> Knowin&#8217; some would like to turn back the hands of time  
> Shame on us  
> (from [stevie-wonder.com](http://www.stevie-wonder.com/song/id_551_get_lyrics_What_The_Fuss.html))

Looking forward to the new album, [A time to love](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00099IACC/forretcom-21/026-0636330-8732461?%5Fencoding=UTF8&camp=1634&link%5Fcode=xm2), out in July 2005!
