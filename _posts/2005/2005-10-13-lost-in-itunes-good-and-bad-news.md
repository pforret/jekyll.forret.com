There's good news and bad news. First the good: Steve Jobs just [issued a wake-up call to the movie industry](http://www.appleinsider.com/article.php?id=1315). He already has shown everyone how to sell music (fixed price, basic DRM, no limits on burning) and hopes to do the same with video. The new [iPod video](http://www.apple.com/itunes/videos/) looks great, and is clearly gonna end up on my desk in the near future.

The bad news: all that &#8220;[Lost](http://abc.go.com/primetime/lost/)&#8220;, &#8220;[Desperate housewives](http://abc.go.com/primetime/desperate/)&#8220;, Pixar, Disney, ABC eye candy is not for us Europeans (apparently not even for all Americans either &#8211; [digitalmusic.weblogsinc.com](http://digitalmusic.weblogsinc.com/entry/1234000303063069/)). Which makes me feel like that great [&#8220;When Harry Met Sally&#8221; song (Harry Connick Jr.)](http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?s=143446&playListId=14702648)

> They're selling shows of &#8220;Lost&#8221;, but not to me.  
> at a very modest cost, but not to me.  
> I'd love to see them play  
> I even want to pay  
> I guess there's just no way but on TV.
> 
> It would be cool to know within the day  
> Is Sawyer just a prick, or is he gay,  
> How long can Jack resist,  
> to grab Kate and french kiss?  
> I guess it's not for me.

I hope that when [digital cinema](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_cinema#Digital_projection) breaks through, films can be released worldwide at the same time and this whole US-first, Europe-afterwards mentality changes. It would reduce a lot of the [BitTorrent traffic](http://www.bittorrent.com/) too. When &#8220;[Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0338013/)&#8221; opens here in [Nov 2004](http://www.cinebel.be/nl/film.asp?Code_film=10226), 8 months after [the release in the USA](http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=eternalsunshine.htm), it is only normal that people who hear the buzz and want to see the movie will find other ways (maybe even -gasp- illegal ones) to see it. It's a global market now, guys. Wake up!
