I went to the DJ booth and turned my head at 45RPM so I could read the name of the artist: &#8220;_Bentzon_&#8220;. Back home, some elementary Googling later:

> [Nikolaj Bentzon](http://www.nikolajbentzon.com) is Denmarks finest Keyboardist and has played alongside David Sanborn, Van Morrison & Joe Henderson amongst many others. For his debut release on Freestyle Records he teams up with the rhythm section from [The Headhunters](http://www.basinstreetrecords.com/artists/headhunters.html):  [Paul Jackson](http://www.pauljackson.jp/fe/index.html) on Bass & [Mick Clark](http://www.drummerworld.com/drummers/Mike_Clark.html) on Drums and pays homage to the genius of the Sugarhill Gangs debut release Rappers Delight.
