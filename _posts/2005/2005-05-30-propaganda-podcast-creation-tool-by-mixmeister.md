While checking for the latests versions of [Mixmeister](http://www.mixmeister.com) software, the excellent audio tool for crafting MP3 mixes, (they&#8217;re at release 6.0 now), I also noticed they just released [Propaganda](http://www.makepropaganda.com/), a Windows software for creating p0dcasts. They&#8217;ve built it on the Mixmeister engine: accurate automatic detection of [BPM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beats_per_minute) (tempo) and downtime (1st beat of a measure), flawless [time-stretching](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_timescale-pitch_modification) (speeding a song up or down without changing the pitch) and manipulation through a timeline based editor. 

They also discovered a better way to limit the capabilities of their demo versions: instead of shutting the program down after 15 minutes &#8211; which is always unpleasant when you&#8217;re in the middle of trying something out &#8211; you now have a voice-over every 5 minutes that announces the fact that you&#8217;re using a trial version. At $49 for the full version, this is a good choice for any podcaster who wants an easy-to-use solution to create his programs.

If you&#8217;re more of a DJ, try one of the [Mixmeister series](http://www.mixmeister.com/products.html) (there&#8217;s a free trial version for each of them): 

  * MixMeister Express 6 ($50)
  * MixMeister Studio 6 ($170 &#8211; key detection and mutiple mixes) 
  * MixMeister Pro 6 ($280 &#8211; with video support).
