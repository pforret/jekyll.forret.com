Have you ever wondered how difficult it is to [beatmix](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beats_per_minute) 2 records? Does one actually have to have skills to be a top-notch DJ like [Roger Sanchez](http://www.rogersanchez.com/) or [Fat Boy Slim](http://www.fatboyslim.net/)? 

You don&#8217;t have to buy a couple of [Technics SL-1200MK2s](http://www.panasonic.com/consumer_electronics/technics_dj/prod_intro_sl1200mk2.asp) ($750/piece), but have a try with the neat freeware tool from MonoRAVEIK: the MR1200. A Windows program of only 152 KB(!!) that emulates a 1200 really nicely. Start up 2 of them, drop an MP3 on both, start the first and then try to beatsync the second while the first is playing (even more realistic: play the first song at 110dB and use headphones on one ear to monitor and beatsync the second song). The Nudge/Twist system is not a sensitive as your fingers holding back or speeding up the vinyl, but it will give you a pretty good idea. Give it a spin!

> * Platter behaves exactly like a real record deck &#8211; grab it and it stops, pull it backwards and it plays backwards.  
> * Platter can also emulate the jog wheel on a CD deck.  
> * Vinyl groove simulation for a &#8220;picture&#8221; of the track &#8211; spot those quiet bits!  
> * Choice of +8 or +20 pitch control, with separate fine tuning.  
> * Nudging and twisting emulation.  
> * Real instant start.  
> * Cue points.  
> * Reverse play.  
> * Pitch control inversion.  
> * Quartz lock.  
> * BPM counter (manual)
