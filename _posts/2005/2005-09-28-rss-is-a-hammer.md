We&#8217;re all excited by the promises of [Web 2.0](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_2.0), we&#8217;re all awaiting the next really neat [remix application/service](http://www.economist.com/printedition/displayStory.cfm?Story_ID=4368150&tranMode=none) of data, meta-data, analysis and presentation. But let&#8217;s not fall for the _&#8220;I have a hammer, so all problems look like a nail&#8221;_ trap. According to me, Dave Winer goes one step to far when he says:

Similarly, in a comment on the excellent &#8220;[The Web 2.0 is here](http://web2.wsj2.com/web2ishere.htm)&#8221; article, [Scott Johnson](http://scott.feedster.com/) writes:

It&#8217;s not because you have particularly strong feelings about one building block of the Web 2.0 temple that you can simplify the whole thing. RSS is important. Ajax is important. And so are REST/XMLRPC/SOAP, KML, social software, folksonomies, contextual advertising, &#8220;Long tail&#8221; logic, Creative Commons, &#8230; It&#8217;s the sum of all these forces that hint at a future &#8220;Web 2.0&#8221; that&#8217;s bigger and brighter.

In the mean time, since I don&#8217;t think [Tim O&#8217;Reilly&#8217;s chart](http://www.flickr.com/photos/36521959321@N01/44349798) is very clear, and even [Dion Hinchcliffe](http://web2.wsj2.com/visualizingweb20.htm)&#8216;s effort is not 100% clear, I&#8217;m working on a visualisation of Web 2.0 on my own.
