[DNS.be](http://www.dns.be), the Belgian non-profit organisation that manages the .be domain, has published [new statistics](http://www.dns.be/en/home.php?n=4) on domain name distribution in Belgium. They added geographical statistics for e.g. [the domain names per inhabitant in 2004](http://www.dns.be/scripts/map.be/imagemap.php?map=2004-1&lang=en). Some numbers:

  * 1000 Brussels: 18,2 _domains/100 inhabitants_ (or &#8216;dom/100&#8217;) 
  * 2000 Antwerp: 16,2 dom/100 
  * 3000 Leuven: 9,5 dom/100 (but 3118 Werchter: 35 dom/100!) 
  * 3500 Hasselt: 7,6 dom/100 
  * 4000 Liege: 2,5 dom/100 (but Sankt Vith: 14,2 dom/100) 
  * 5000 Namur: 3,5 dom/100 
  * 6000 Charleroi: 2,8 dom/100 
  * 7000 Mons: 2,5 dom/100 
  * 8000 Brugge: 5,4 dom/100 
  * 9000 Gent: 7,2 dom/100

Wallonie may seem already a bit behind here, but it gets worse when you go outside of the major cities: where in Flanders most villages/municipalities have on average > 2 domain per 100 inhabitants (_like my hometown: 8840 Staden: 4,6 dom/100_), in Wallonie not even half of the villages have one domain name per 100 inhabitants. This gives contrasts like: 3300 Tienen: 2,9 dom/100, and 1357 H&eacute;l&eacute;cine, right next door: 0,7 dom/100. 

This reminds me of the launch we did of the StaatsbladClip email newsletter: the subscriptions were 10 to 1 Flemish. In the weekend, we would have peaks of the Dutch-language subscriptions, while the traffic on the French-language newsletter would be just about dead. Flemish people go home and switch on the PC. In Wallonie, they put on their boots and go hunting.

Some more weird numbers:

  * being close to France does not seem to incite more DNS activity, however being close to Germany (the Rocherath/Sankt Vith area) has a positive effect. 
  * what&#8217;s with 3461 Molenbeek (Bekkevoort)? Every town in the vicinity has a normal score (1,5-3 dom/100) but they are at 0,4. Is there some other demographic responsible for this (like: no ADSL available there, average age > 75 years)? 
  * the 2nd best score is for 1831 Diegem: 20 dom/100, which might have something to do with the number of IT companies in its industry parks. But why does Werchter score 35 dom/100? Who registered those 1091 domains? [Rock Werchter](http://www.rockwerchter.be/)? A pro-active DNS registrar?
