Things you learn in bars: the list of things girls look for in a guy (or, in this case, as cited by Nathalie and An).  
I use the following scale: 1 = nice to have &#8230; 3 = definite bonus &#8230; 5 = really important, and 6 = _conditio sine qua non_ (if you don&#8217;t qualify, forget it). I averaged the weights of both authors. In all cases, the desired answer is &#8216;yes&#8217;.

  * 6: is he free (not married, no girlfriend)? 
  * 6: is he over his previous relationship? 
  * 5: do you feel like you could grow old together and still have stuff to tell each other? 
  * 5: does he enjoy sex (or as one of the authors phrased it: can he get it up)? 
  * 4: does he have a job that interest/challenges/thrill him? 
  * 4: is he pleasant company in the morning (kind of objective: he should talk little/not be too depressed/not be too jolly/not be horny)? 
  * 3: if he has kids, does he have an easy/trouble-free settlement? 
  * 3: is he not a colleague (terribly annoying once the affair is over, it appears)? 
  * 3: is he clean (like: take a shower at least once a day, change underwear regularly)? 
  * 2: does he like (to provide) surprises? 
  * 1: can he cook?

Which is fairly optimistic compared to [What Women Want at ages 22, 32, 42, 52, 62 and 72](http://www.big-boys.com/joke.asp?ID=1355)

> What Women Want in a Man, Revised List (**age 52**)

> 4. Doesn&#8217;t nod off to sleep when I&#8217;m venting  
> 5. Doesn&#8217;t re-tell the same joke too many times  
> 6. Is in good enough shape to get off couch on weekends  
> 7. Usually wears matching socks and fresh underwear  
> 8. Appreciates a good TV dinner  
> 9. Remembers your name on occasion
