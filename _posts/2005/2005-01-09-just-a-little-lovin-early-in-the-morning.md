I have an extensive collection DJ mixes on my hard disk, and a while ago I discovered in one of them a catchy tune. It starts as a laidback ([112 BPM](http://web.forret.com/tools/bpm.asp)) love song, a crooner voice singing &#8220;_Just a little lovin', early in the morning, just a little lovin', early in the day &#8230;_&#8220;. It then turns into a groovy re-edit of the same song, with the voice nicely cut up to match the new tempo ([124 BPM](http://web.forret.com/tools/bpm.asp)). There are some added vocals that are a bit silly (clearly a non-native English speaker), but the chorus is really addictive. For some reason it stayed glued to the back of my head, I caught myself whistling it several times a day. But what was it?

I had no idea in which show/mix tape I heard it, and didn't see myself browsing through over 100 hours of MP3 and RM files just to find it. Thanks to Google, I quickly found out the new version was created by [Irfane (a French DJ and part of Outlines)](http://www.sonarkollektiv.de/artists/outlines/), [back in 2003](http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/urban/peterson/030320_miami.shtml). The original seems to be a <del datetime="2006-04-29T09:05:27+00:00">Barry Manilow</del> [Barry Mann/Cynthia Weill](http://mann-weil.com/) song, performed by great singers like Dusty Springfield and Sarah Vaughan. Apparently clearing the rights on the Springfield performance has proven so difficult that the song is only coming out in March 2005, on [Sonar Kollektiv](http://www.sonarkollektiv.de/), the [Jazzanova](http://www.sonarkollektiv.de/artists/jazzanova/) record label.

UPDATE: this is the video!
