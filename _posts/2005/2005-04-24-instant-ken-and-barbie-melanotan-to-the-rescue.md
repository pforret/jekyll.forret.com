> Thus a drug called melanotan (&#8230;), which was developed as an analogue of this hormone to promote a natural tan as protection against skin cancer, was found to have the side effect of dramatically increasing libido in men and women during clinical trials. Female rats increased their rate of copulation by 300% after a dose of melanotan, and 80% men suffering from impotence reported getting normal erections after taking this drug. Melanotan also inhibits appetite by suppressing the action of the hunger center of the hypothalamus. **So it makes you tanned, thin and horny** &#8211; which is why it is sometimes called the &#8220;Ken and Barbie drug.&#8221;
