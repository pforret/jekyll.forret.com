The Belgian Minister of Economy, Marc Verwilghen, recently announced the efforts the Belgian government would take to restore trust in the Internet as a way of doing business. This includes a directory of trustworthy online shops (e.g. in the travel business), but also some efforts to reduce spam. On the site [spamsquad.be](http://www.spamsquad.be/) the following 4 basic rules are described to avoid spam: 1) don&#8217;t leave your email address, 2) don&#8217;t answer dubious emails, 3) camouflage your email address and 4) protect your computer. 

As I [said before](http://blog.forret.com/blog/2004/12/10-free-tools-to-make-your-pc-safer.html), I think they forget one important detail, the main reason spam exists: _&#8220;Don&#8217;t be stupid&#8221;_. 

* Don&#8217;t buy your V*agra from people who can&#8217;t even spell the drug&#8217;s name right
* If you buy the product that would make you &#8220;SCARE PEOPLE WITH YOUR HUGE C*CK&#8221;, how exactly is that going to help you? 
* Don&#8217;t give money to a perfect stranger who needs you to help recover X million from his father, the recently deceased president of some banana republic. 
* Don&#8217;t buy a economics degree on-line, you&#8217;re only proving you&#8217;re not worth it. 


## SPAM ECONOMICS

If you try to distill the spammer&#8217;s logic into a simple formula, check this:
                
> **P$ = [N \* (I% \* S% \* W% \* B% \* M$)] &#8211; (N \* E$) &#8211; (L% \* C% \* R$)**  
> where  
> P$ = profit, bottom-line
> 
> N = number of emails sent (can be millions!)  
> I% = % of addresses that are valid/correct  
> S% = % of addresses that are not intercepted by anti-spam software  
> W% = % of emails to cause the receiver to go visit the website  
> B% = % of site visitors that actually buy the product  
> M$ = margin per product sold
> 
> E$ = cost of sending 1 email
> 
> L% = risk of having legal action taken against you  
> C% = risk of getting convicted when you&#8217;re in court  
> R$ = average fine you would have to pay
                
The parameters I%, S% and E$ are defined by technology, and government should not mingle with that. Spam detection technology is a very active line of research and new products and/or services are coming out all the times. Yahoo, Microsoft, IETF, &#8230; are trying to reshape email so sending email to 5 million addresses isn&#8217;t so darn easy, but again, these issues are technical, we don&#8217;t need any minister to tell us or buy us a solution. L%, C% and R$, on the other hand, are very much things that should be dealt with on a national level: law-making and law-enforcing. But I doubt if many of the big spammers are Belgian, so there is little the Belgian government can do about that. 
                
## SPAM-EDUTAINMENT
                
The main focus of this country should be focused on reducing W% (website conversion) and B% (buyer conversion), the _&#8216;naivite&#8217;_ parameters, and the weapon of choice there is education. The Belgian federal agency [Fedict](http://www.fedict.be) has already done a fine job by launching [peeceefobie.be](http://www.peeceefobie.be), a consumer-oriented portal on PC security with some good advise on spam-mail ([Dutch](http://www.belgium.be/peeceefobie/html/3-emails.htm)). But to reach Average Joe and Jane, they should use TV and radio. I would like to see an entertaining program on internet security that teaches people the PC security basics and that has humoristic sketches like [In De Gloria](http://www.indegloria.be/). I would like to hear a program on Internet crime in the [Sample Minds](http://www.stubru.be/stubru_master/programmas/de_sample_minds/home/) style. 
                
If someone drives a gasoline car and fills it with diesel/fuel, he will be made fun of, because you're supposed to know these things when you have a car. The same should happen to someone who lost money in an on-line scam. Invest $500 and get $50.000 from a dyslexic Russian dude who won't disclose anything but a Hotmail address? Come on, you fell for that one?
