After I saw [Tim O&#8217;Reilly's Web 2.0 mememap](http://www.flickr.com/photos/36521959321@N01/44349798/) (via [readwriteweb.com](http://readwriteweb.com/archives/002834.php)) and [Dion Hinchcliffe](http://web2.wsj2.com/visualizingweb20.htm)&#8216;s visualisation of Web 2.0, I realised they didn't cut it for me. They were somewhat confusing and chaotic. So I [decided to make one myself](/2005/09/28/rss-is-a-hammer/).

So here it is: Peter's effort for a better [**Web 2.0 mememap visualisation**](http://www.flickr.com/photos/pforret/47674175):

Some examples:

  * [HousingMaps](http://www.housingmaps.com) (mentioned on [The Economist](http://www.economist.com/printedition/displayStory.cfm?Story_ID=4368150&tranMode=none)) takes the houses on Craigslist (&#8220;USER DATA&#8221; and &#8220;METADATA&#8221;), gets the geo-coordinates for each address (&#8220;ANNOTATE&#8221;) and shows them on Google Maps (&#8220;VISUALIZE&#8221;)
  * [Plazes.com](http://www.plazes.com) takes your network topology and the address you attach to it ( &#8220;METADATA&#8221;), geomaps it (&#8220;ANNOTATE&#8221;), and shows you who&#8217;s near to you (&#8220;FILTER&#8221;). It also show your Plazes on Google Maps (&#8220;VISUALIZE&#8221;).
  * [Matt Biddulph](http://www.hackdiary.com/archives/000070.html) takes a list of people (&#8220;USER DATA&#8221;), uses the Yahoo Search API to find their page in Wikipedia (&#8220;ANNOTATE&#8221; with other &#8220;USER DATA&#8221; thanks to the Yahoo! &#8220;AGGREGATE&#8221; engine) and then looks for links to the other people in the list (&#8220;METADATA&#8221;). He then uses this information to create a map with arrows between the names (&#8220;VISUALIZE&#8221;). I particularly like this one, very inventive!
  * [Pixagogo Maps](http://maps.pixagogo.com) takes your images (&#8220;USER DATA&#8221;), allows you to add tags/labels to them (&#8220;METADATA&#8221;), and again maps them on to Google Maps (&#8220;VISUALIZE&#8221;)
  * [extispicious](http://kevan.org/extispicious.cgi) takes your del.icio.us tags (&#8220;METADATA&#8221;) or Yahoo pictures (&#8220;USER DATA&#8221; but also &#8220;AGGREGATED&#8221;) and draws a tag cloud (&#8220;VISUALIZE&#8221;)
  * [Writely](http://www.writely.com) offers editing of user documents (&#8220;USER DATA&#8221;) with a WYSIWYG Ajax editor (&#8220;RICH UI&#8221;) and allows for tagging (&#8220;METADATA&#8221;). This is not really a &#8220;remix&#8221; kind of service, but it qualifies for Web 2.0 nevertheless.

All input is welcome, since this is only the first version (let's call it v0.1).
