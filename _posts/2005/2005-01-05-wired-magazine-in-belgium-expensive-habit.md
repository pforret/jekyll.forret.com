In this geeky world I&#8217;m in, there are few magazines as spot-on and influential as [Wired Magazine](http://www.wired.com/wired/). It&#8217;s one of the magazines I keep around for years after publication.

> Wired was important not just because it was the first magazine to make the computer world seem hip; it also trained its eye on the implications of the onrushing new technology, not merely on appraising the newest machines and trendiest gadgets.

I typically buy a copy of Wired when I&#8217;m in an airport, because they don&#8217;t carry it in most Belgian bookshops. So this year I thought: let&#8217;s just pretend we&#8217;re wealthy and buy a year&#8217;s subscription. I clicked the &#8216;Subscribe&#8217; button on the site, and lo and behold, a year&#8217;s subscription only costs $10! (That&#8217;s about the same price as I pay over here for a single issue.) Great! Oh wait, that&#8217;s for US only. Let&#8217;s check &#8216;International&#8217;: for Europeans it&#8217;s **a hefty $70**.

Even if $70 is not the end of the world, why on earth would I pay a 600% premium for just transport? This made me think of the [Brewster Kahle speech on NotCon 2004](http://www.hatch.org/blog/2004/07/09/brewster_kahle_universal_access_to_human_knowledge.php). The founder of the Internet Archive has set up the [Internet BookMobile](http://www.archive.org/texts/bookmobile.php), a vehicle with all technology on board (Internet, color printer, binding machine) to print books on demand. His claim is that it costs $1 to print a black/white book with a color cover, while it costs $2 for a library to handle the lending of a book. Printing a self-made book (uploaded in PDF format) through the [CafePress](http://www.cafepress.com) site costs $4.50. [Kinkos](http://print2.kinkos.com/) charges a bit more ($5.95). So if one had to print 1000 copies for Western Europe and ship them from France, Germany or Poland (cheaper labor), this should be possible for less than $5 per copy?

So here&#8217;s my question: given the state-of-the-art in on-demand printing technology, isn&#8217;t it possible to have US-based magazines digitally transferred to a European location and printed closer to the reader? So I could subscribe to Wired, [Fast Company](http://www.fastcompany.com/) ($56 for Europe instead of $12), [Business 2.0](http://www.business2.com/b2/), [Rolling Stone](http://www.rollingstone.com) ($65 for Europe instead of $13), [Time Magazine](http://www.time.com/time/), [Newsweek](http://msnbc.msn.com/id/3032542/) (70&euro; instead of $30 per year) and &#8211; what the heck &#8211; [Playboy](http://www.playboy.com) ($45 for Europe instead of $12) for what one Wired subscription costs now?
