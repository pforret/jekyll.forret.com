He probably also first thought it was an April&#8217;s Fool joke:  
[Matt Mullenweg](http://photomatt.net/) from [WordPress](http://www.wordpress.org/) was discovered to have used his PageRank 8 site (WordPress is a popular open-source blogging software) for hosting lots of irrelevant content, with the purpose to get high scores in Google rankings and (let a customer of his) make money on Google Adsense.

> The content in articles is essentially advertising by a third party that we host for a flat fee. I&#8217;m not sure if we&#8217;re going to continue it much longer, but we&#8217;re committed to this month at least, it was basically an experiment. However around the beginning of Feburary donations were going down as expenses were ramping up, so it seemed like a good way to cover everything. The adsense on those pages is not ours and I have no idea what they get on it, we just get a flat fee. The money is used just like donations but more specifically it&#8217;s been going to the business/trademark expenses so it&#8217;s not entirely out of my pocket anymore.

[Andy Baio (Waxy) broke the news](http://www.waxy.org/archive/2005/03/30/wordpres.shtml) on March 30th, at a moment when Matt was on holiday (and off-line), so he only [replied on April 1st](http://photomatt.net/2005/04/01/a-response/), about a thousand angry emails later. His defense is that it was a interesting idea, badly implemented, not followed up and never evaluated. Since Matt does not have the profile of a cash-hungry opportunist, and he&#8217;s explaining this to an audience of people that understand these reasons (reads like an IT project management what-not-to-do list), the storm will probably blow over.

Normally this is the kind of situation where one would say: &#8220;SEO? Leave that to the professionals!&#8221;. But the fact is that here in Belgium, some of the companies that claim to be SEO specialists, use dirty tricks all over. Hidden links, bot [cloaking](http://www.google.com/webmasters/faq.html#cloaking), keyword spamming, `<noscript>` tricks, the whole shebang. It&#8217;s like they read the [Google SEO warning page](http://www.google.com/webmasters/seo.html) as a guideline. _&#8220;Hey look! We could put ourselves and other customers on every client&#8217;s doorway pages. Neat!&#8221;_.
