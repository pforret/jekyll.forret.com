Just added a new on-line tool to the [FORRET TOOLS collection](http://web.forret.com/tools/):  
the [guitar fretboard generator](http://web.forret.com/tools/guitar.asp), that allows one to quickly see which frets on which strings are which notes. I needed it because I started playing my [5-string bass](http://web.forret.com/tools/guitar.asp?title=5-string+bass&strings=5&string1=B&string2=E&string3=A&string4=D&string5=G) again and I get all stressed out when someone asks me to quickly play that G# on the 4th string (6th fret, actually).

I also included some examples of alternative tuning (e.g. the [open G tuning](http://web.forret.com/tools/guitar.asp?title=open+G+tuning&strings=6&string1=D&string2=G&string3=D&string4=G&string5=B&string6=D) used a lot in blues music or the Stones&#8217; &#8220;Brown Sugar&#8221;). If you ever wanted to know what a [bluegrass banjo tuning](http://web.forret.com/tools/guitar.asp?title=5-string+banjo&strings=5&string1=D&string2=B&string3=G&string4=D&string5=G) looks like (D-B-G-D-G)&#8230;
