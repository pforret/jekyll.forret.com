> TL;DR: I am starting a community with in-person events for discussing A.I. First one will happen in Oct/Nov 2025. Join the mailing list at [Prompt Parlour](https://pforret.kit.com/promptparlour) if you are interested.

Back in April 2023, I gave a speech on [Generative A.I. at CommPass](https://commpass.media/media-innovation-session/). 
ChatGPT had been launched some months before and had become the fastest product ever to reach 10 million users (in 40 days).
We're now 2,5 years later, and we are still speeding up. There's Cursor, Claude Code, Veo3, Nano Banana, Runway, and new announcements every week.

As an engineer, I am excited, then as well as now. As a father, as a citizen, I am worried. The pace of change is breathtaking, and I am not sure we as a society are ready for it.

My friends know I have been talking about A.I. for a long time: the technology, the applications, the impact on jobs and society.
I have been mostly a missionary, sometimes a sceptic. 
I am now looking for other missionaries, entrepreneurs, sceptics and curious people. This thing is big. We need to talk about it.

I couldn't find a community that offers what I'm looking for, so I am starting it myself, like I did in 2006 with [Barcamp Brussels](/tag/barcamp/). 
That was fun to do, I learned a lot, and I met plenty of interesting people.

## Introducing [**Prompt Parlour**](https://promptparlour.com/)

**Prompt Parlour** is a Belgian community for people interested in artificial intelligence and its impact on business, society and our personal lives.
We will organize in-person events with speakers, panels and discussion opportunities.

I have created a [mailing list](https://pforret.kit.com/promptparlour) to keep you informed of upcoming events.
Please sign up if you are interested.

I would like to follow the Barcamp principles: open, participative, and community-driven. 
Speakers are there to share their knowledge, not to sell stuff.

I'm planning the first event in October or November 2025, depending on venue and speaker possibilities.
