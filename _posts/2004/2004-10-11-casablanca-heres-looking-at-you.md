Well there's a reputation well earned: [Casablanca](http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0034583) is one of the best films I've seen recently. I know it's been out for a while (it was released in 1942) but I only bought the DVD last weekend. Great cast (Bogart as cool as a three-star freezer), strong script (Bergman torn between the two loves of her life, and then some WWII thrown in), and superb dialogues.

> Captain Renault : _What in heaven's name brought you to Casablanca?_  
> Rick : _My health. I came to Casablanca for the waters._  
> Captain Renault : _The waters? What waters? We're in the desert._  
> Rick : _I was misinformed._
