[Kevin Cornell](https://kevincornell.me/) is an illustrator from Philadelphia and has published his BearSkinRug sketchbook #1 on the web.

> This was my sketchbook between July 2002 and February 2003. I have posted the book in its entirety &#8211; front cover to back cover. Although a compilation of select drawings would have been smaller (and easier to put together), I felt posting the entire contents was necessary for it to be regarded as a full composition.

An amusing view into the mind and imagination of a talented guy, presented in a very appealing Flash interface.

Also check out his main site on [bearskinrug.co.uk](https://www.v5.bearskinrug.co.uk/), there&#8217;s a tamagotchi ice bear on top to keep you company (it eats rabbits and chickens).
