I actually use the script to send our customer mailings, so now it works ;-).  
<http://pypersomail.sourceforge.net/>

Some features:  
&#8211; sending personalised emails 1 by 1, using CSV file as input  
&#8211; throttling: the script waits for 60 seconds between batches of 500 mails, otherwise it can bring its SMTP server on its knees  
&#8211; progress: print a line of logging every 250 messages, so you see what&#8217;s happening

TODO:  
&#8211; automatically generate TXT template from HTML template  
&#8211; check for email address syntax (e.g. wrong TLD, no &#8216;@&#8217; sign, &#8230;)  
&#8211; send summary information to source email address when finished  
&#8211; find some system for processing of bounces  
&#8211; use a black-list of people never to send anything to
