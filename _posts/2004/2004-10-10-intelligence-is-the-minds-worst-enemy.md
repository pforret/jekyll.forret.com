If you&#8217;re interested in high level conversations on a wide range of topics, check out [edge.org](http://www.edge.org/). Their motto: _To arrive at the edge of the world&#8217;s knowledge, seek out the most complex and sophisticated minds, put them in a room together, and have them ask each other the questions they are asking themselves._  
There&#8217;s fascinating stuff about quantum computing and black swan dynamics, but a piece in the last publication jumped out, a discussion on &#8216;A self worth having&#8217;:

> An increasing intelligence would also reach a point where it became aware of its own intelligence and that&#8217;s a highly dangerous spot because an intelligence that was naked and transparent would be susceptible to intellectual manipulation. The first thing that a mind smart enough to see itself would do is start to hack itself.  
> [Kevin Kelly (on edge.org)](http://www.edge.org/documents/archive/edge145.html) 

The irony of this is that the research performed by Mr. Kelly is doing just that: trying to hack the mind. But he makes a great point. The above quote actually comes from a reply to an earlier article, the original &#8216;A self worth having&#8217; thesis:

> This case stayed with me � to remind me, if I should ever forget, how much consciousness matters. Even to the extent that mattering may be one of the main reasons why consciousness exists. What if it&#8217;s consciousness that gives us a reason for waking up every day, and going out into the world �to experience the qualia of a rainbow, the sunset, music, interactions with our friends, sex, food? What if consciousness provides such an incentive for living that, as human beings, we would not � and probably could not � do without it?  
> [Nicholas Humphrey (on edge.org)](http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/humphrey04/humphrey04_index.html) 

So, making out under a rainbow, Marvin Gaye in the background, just after a picknick with some excellent Sancerre is not by accident an enjoyable event: you are actually celeberating the Self. And far too busy to start picking your own mind.
