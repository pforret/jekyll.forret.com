You can argue about some of the entries, but [50 coolest songs parts ever](http://www.retrocrush.com/archive2004/coolsongs/index.html) is a pretty great list of songs with the little extra that has made them stick around in your mind, or makes you start headbanging every time you hear them.

I mean stuff like: **Prince**&#8216;s faster-than-light guitar solo in _Let&#8217;s go crazy_ &#8212; **Queen**&#8216;s classic gay-but-cool-as-hell anthem _Bohemian Rhapsody_ (where&#8217;s ABBA, by the way?) &#8212; **Jimi Hendrix**&#8216; _Voodoo Chile_ (look at that cover image, didn&#8217;t you get arrested for stuff like that in those days?) &#8212; **Madness**&#8216; slightly deranged _One Step Beyond_ &#8212; the coolest **Rolling Stones** intro ever in _Sympathy for the devil_ &#8212; **Van Halen**&#8216;s drum solo on _Teacher_ (those can&#8217;t all be bass pedals, right?) &#8212; and on #1: **Phil Collins**&#8216; monumental gated drum climax on _In The Air tonight_.

Which reminds me: I&#8217;m gonna see Phil Collins live this Sunday on [TW/Classic](http://www.twclassic.be).
