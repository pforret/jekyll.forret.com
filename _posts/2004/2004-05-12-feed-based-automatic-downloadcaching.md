Interesting idea on [HubLog](http://www.pmbrowser.info/hublog/archives/000830.html "Hublog") (actually it&#8217;s an idea of [Les Orchard](http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2004/05/10/homebrew_entertainment_appliances_cheap_open_and_embattled)).

> I&#8217;d love to pay a monthly fee to have shows by Joss Whedon stream on down to my file-server with BitTorrent. I&#8217;d love to subscribe to favorite indie bands&#8217; releases and have them show up in the music folder. I&#8217;m cheap, so I&#8217;d like the price to be low, but I&#8217;ll still pay for what I like. And I&#8217;d love to do all this, still being able to tinker, still seeing that people producing things I like get paid, without going to jail or letting them empty my wallet with a wet/dry vac. 

Sounds a bit like a RSS+BitTorrent version of [MMS](http://www.nowsms.com/framer.htm?http://www.nowsms.com/discus/messages/1/589.html), which basically is a combination of an SMS notification and a GPRS download. Do RSS and/or Atom have extensions that could support this? Looking at [Orchard](http://orchard.sourceforge.net/) I would guess that with RSS, you would have to use a hack like &#8216;_automatically follow all links if they point to a .mpg file_&#8216;. Atom seems to provide for a [Link:Type](http://www.atomenabled.org/developers/syndication/atom-format-spec.php#rfc.section.3.4.2) attribute, which allows neater integration.

So the system could be as follows:

  * a watcher application periodically checks certain RSS/Atom links (basically this is an aggregator) 
  * it triggers on certain conditions, like the occurence of a `type="video/mpeg"` mime-type link, or a link that ends in `.mpg/.mpeg` 
  * when it triggers it starts downloading in one of several ways, (S)FTP, BitTorrent, &#8230; &#8211; presumably you would need proper authentication (this is where payment comes in) 
  * you are alerted when new content is available on your local system (this could be a 2nd &#8216;delayed&#8217; feed) 

It&#8217;s basically caching of content before it is consumed. _Pre-caching_?
