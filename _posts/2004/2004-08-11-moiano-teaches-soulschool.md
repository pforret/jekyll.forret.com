Just bought a surprisingly good debut album: &#8220;Soulschool&#8221; by [Moiano](http://www.moiano.com). It&#8217;s a Belgian band started by Peter Lesage, who has played the keyboards for [Gabriel Rios](http://www.gabrielrios.be/), [Flip Kowlier](http://www.flipkowlier.be/), [Krewcial](http://www.krewcial.com/). He&#8217;s now got a band of talented musicians around him.

About the album: there&#8217;s elements of Prince (_&#8220;I think of u&#8221;_ for instance, and not only for the title typo, and _&#8220;Little less&#8221;_ even has Peter Lesage convincingly screaming like the little man from Minneapolis), James Brown (the groove on _&#8220;The music and you&#8221;_ snuggles up to Sexmachine), and even Steely Dan (for some reason this is what pops into my mind when I hear the chorus on _&#8220;She knows&#8221;_ &#8211; which is a fabulous track). The production quality is outstanding, every detail in perfect place, especially the horn and voice arrangements.

From what I hear, they&#8217;re also a great live act, so I&#8217;ll have to check that out. Anyway: these guys are going places!

The album is not yet available on Amazon, but you can buy it on [Proxis](http://oas2000.proxis.be/gate/jabba.coreii.g_p?bi=4&sp=DETAILS&mi=4729742&si=56506626 "Buy Moiano's Soulschool @ Proxis").
