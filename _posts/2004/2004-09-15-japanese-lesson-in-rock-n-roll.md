Nothing like an enthusiastic engineer to sell a home entertainment keyboard.  
A commercial for the Creative &#8216;Prodikeys&#8217; product (music and &#8216;normal&#8217; keyboard in one) features an archetypical Japanese sales guy teaching us how to play rock &#8216;n roll drums on a MIDI keyboard. This is not the best way to play drums, and he adequately proves this point. 

I couldn&#8217;t help but put a soundtrack under it, it was too tempting. This was the original [Prodikeys commercial (WMV)](http://www.prodikeys.com/products/prodikeys_DM/watch/5_Drums_Low.wmv) and this is the whole new [**Smoothpod mashup**](http://mashup.xampled.com/2004/09/japanese-rock-n-roll-prodikeys.html). Eat you heart out, Elvis!
