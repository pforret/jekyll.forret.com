Let&#8217;s say you need an (approximate) count of the number of lines in a huge file. The most obvious way of calculating this would be using `wc`, but this actually can be quite slow:  
`# time wc -l /var/log/squid/access.log<br />
2812824 /var/log/squid/access.log<br />
real    0m43.988s`  
(counting is done at 64.000 lines/sec)

Running `wc` without the `-l` (only count lines) would be ever slower because it would also count the words, instead of just the LF (linefeed) characters. But using `wc -c` is very fast! This is because the filesystem keeps track of each file&#8217;s filesize (= number of characters/bytes), so the file does not even have to be read to give this number. Can we estimate the # of lines from the # of bytes?

For the type of file we are talking about here (a Squid log file) there actually is a way. The file is more or less &#8216;square&#8217;, meaning that every line is about the same length (it contains date, status, URL, &#8230;).  
If we take the beginning of the file (the first 10000 lines):  
`# head -10000 /var/log/squid/access.log | wc<br />
  10000  100000 1775257`  
we see that every line is about 177 chars long.

The end of the file (the last 10000 lines):  
`# tail -10000 /var/log/squid/access.log | wc<br />
  10000  100000 2047887`  
gives us a number of 204 chars/line.

Let&#8217;s take some more data and combine both:  
`# ( head -50000 /var/log/squid/access.log ; tail -50000 /var/log/squid/access.log ) | wc<br />
 100000 1000000 19488905`  
which gives us an average of 195 chars/line.

A file size of 533.229.920 bytes (533MB) would lead us to estimate the # of lines to 2.734.512, where the actual # of lines is 2.818.184 (3% difference). That is: we lose 3% accuracy but the calculation takes almost no CPU time, instead of 45 seconds. This might be a trade-off you are willing to accept!
