Some Californian guy with a funny accent made an amusing Flash movie on [**The end of the world**](http://www.mit.edu/~mikeho/media/endofworld.swf), which has been circulating since 2003. No one seems to know who the author was. The movie has its own site [www.endofworld.net](http://www.endofworld.net/), but even the people who set it up have no clue who made the movie. I guess not everyone needs his 15 minutes of fame.

It does confirm some prejudices the Americans have: the English are phlegmatic, the French lazy, the Chinese stupid, the Russians rude soldiers and French women don&#8217;t shave their armpits.
