I don't know if it's because I'm a Virgo or because it's Spring, but this weekend I felt the irresistible urge to empty my CD racks and re-organize my CDs. I have about 400 CDs, and I have a tendency of messing them all up if I have no structure I can follow. It's not as bad as my cousin _Quasi-Modo_, who keeps dozens of CDs and DVDs on one large stack, and owns LOADS of empty boxes, but anyway &#8230; (Weird, he's a Virgo too?)

So how can I organize them? What should be the logic? I remembered this quote from [Dave Winer](http://www.scripting.com)

> Well, I think there are three ways of managing and finding information: **chronology**, which is blogs, **search**, and **taxonomy** (&#8230;) [Dave Winer, while visiting Microsoft](http://www.jarretthousenorth.com/davewineratmicrosoft.html).

Let me _re-taxonomize_ this to: **sorted**, **categorized** and **indexed**.

## Sorted

> Storing in a certain order, defined by a number of sortable non-ambiguous parameters (numbers/text). Typically, this leaves you with a one-dimensional space where each album has its coordinates. Micro-organization of a library: per author/title. Mental image: a sorted **Excel sheet**.  
> For CDs: release year, label, album, artist name (but watch out with Me'Shell Ndegeo'cello, The The), &#8230;

  * _Release year/Artist name :_ nice for a historical overview but not practical. Who knows you should look for [Original Musiquarium](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00004ZDVQ/forretcom-21) under 1982?
  * _Date of purchase :_ like John Cusack in [High Fidelity](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/HighFidelity-1095420/). If you remember in which sequence you bought all your CDs, you either don't have many, or you need to get a life.
  * _Artist name/Album Name :_ Like most record shops, but almost half of my CDs are compilations, so this means 200 albums under &#8216;Various Artists'?
  * _By ASIN/ISBN/barcode number :_ feasible, but pointless. Good for warehousing, not for humans.

## Categorized

> Storing in a taxonomy of preferably non-intersecting groups and subgroups, based on easy-to-discern characteristics. Macro-organization of a library: fiction/non-fiction/poetry/&#8230; Mental image: **Outlook folders**.  
> For CDs: genre, compilation, record company, sleeve colour, artist gender, &#8230;

  * _Genre :_ Where is the line between Electronic, Dance, Acid Jazz, Nu Jazz, Lounge, Chill-out, Deep House? Who is the authority on this? Does Quincy Jones go with Jazz? Even [Stuff like that](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000002GC4/forretcom-21)?
  * _Compilation/not :_ I used this one because it's an easy split. An album is either a compilation or not, right? What do I do with DJ Spinna's [Wonder of Stevie](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00009Z5G7/forretcom-21)? I went with &#8216;compilation'.
  * _Label :_ great for storing (the side logos all measure up nicely), less trivial for finding something
  * _Artist Gender :_ male/female/group. (any other options I did not think of?) Diana Ross would be separate from Diana Ross & the Supremes? Where does Dana International go? ğŸ™‚ 

## Indexed

> Storing in a way that information can be found by searching on keywords and/or properties. Mental image: **Google**. 

This would be my ideal way of buying music: I purchase an album/a song &#8211; I get a token/proof of purchase &#8211; using this token, the music automatically &#8216;shows up' on my PC in a format I can use for burning CDs, loading onto my portable player &#8211; I can search for artists, genre, title and even have collaborative filtering: &#8216;music that sound like Jazzanova'. 

Basically this is iTunes. Does this work with 'real' CDs? Apart from manually scrolling through your collection (which can be a physical pleasure with the occasional surprise) I see no implementation of this. Virgin Megastore used to have something inspiring though: you scrolled through their huge selection, took out any CD, showed its barcode to a reader, and could listen to 30-seconds excerpts of each song.

## Conclusion  

So what did I end up with? A custom mix of Sorted & Categorized:

  * Category &#8216;Compilations' -> Categories &#8216;Lounge', &#8216;Jazz', &#8216;Chill out', &#8230; -> Sorted on Album name 
  * Category &#8216;Non-Compilations' -> Categories &#8216;Jazz'/'the rest' -> Sorted on Artist/Album name  
    
Satisfying weekend ğŸ˜‰
