Great post on Steve Gadd on [MetaFilter](https://www.metafilter.com/32962/Drums-of-the-bohicans). He's one of the reasons I wanted to start drumming, after hearing him on Simon & Garfunkel's &#8220;Concert in Central Park&#8221;. When I started browsing through the [Steve Gadd Grooves and Fills](https://www.drstevegadd.com/videos), I discovered that he was also responsible for &#8220;Chuck E's In Love&#8221; (Rickie Lee Jones) and &#8220;Stuff Like That&#8221; (Quincy Jones). Tunes that got stuck in my head. He's probably on more of my CDs than I can imagine. Janis Ian, Michael Franks, Al Jarreau, Michael McDonald, Steely Dan, &#8230;

I wonder who his worthy counterpart would be as a bass player (in my collection, then). Tony Levin? Pino Palladino? [Anthony Jackson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Jackson_(musician))? My vote would go to the latter.
