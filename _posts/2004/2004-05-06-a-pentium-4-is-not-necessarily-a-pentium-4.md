I was throwing my DAW system together, first time I actually &#8216;built&#8217; my own PC, and I thought it went kind of smooth. But my PC did not want to boot every other time. It just started beeping ee-oo-ee-oo, which [indicated a CPU problem](http://bioscentral.com/beepcodes/awardbeep.htm). I upgraded to the newest BIOS posted on the Aopen site, and then I got the real culprit: 

> This motherboard does not support Prescott CPU, turn off power to prevent damage.

As if I should know the difference between a Prescott and a Northwood processor&#8230; I didn&#8217;t even know I bought a Prescott.  
Anyway, this [Anandtech article](http://www.anandtech.com/news/shownews.html?i=20014) made it clear: both use Socket 478, but my i865G motherboard only accepts the older ones. Well, I&#8217;m learning and that was the purpose. I&#8217;ll change my Pentium4 for a Pentium 4.
