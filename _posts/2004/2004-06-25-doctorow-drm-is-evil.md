Some stuff you just know without being able to express it adequately. I hate badly designed copy-protection schemes, but I couldn&#8217;t find the right arguments to make my case without being &#8216;against&#8217; artist. And then someone better informed comes along and sums it all up in a well-thought and clear presentation. That&#8217;s what happened with this speech  [on DRM (Digital Rights Management) by Cory Doctorow](http://www.dashes.com/anil/stuff/doctorow-drm-ms.html) at Microsoft Research.

His five main points are:

  * DRM systems don&#8217;t work  
    > _&#8220;all DRM systems share a common vulnerability: they provide their attackers with ciphertext, the cipher and the key.&#8221;_ Public Key cryptography is not entirely done justice here, but brings with it a whole other truckload of problems: revocation, trust hierarchy, &#8230;

  * DRM systems are bad for society  
    > Great quote: _&#8220;Remember Schneier&#8217;s Law? Anyone can come up with a security system so clever that he can&#8217;t see its flaws.&#8221; and on DVD regions: &#8220;There&#8217;s no copyright here or in anywhere I know of that says that an author should be able to control **where** you enjoy her creative works, once you&#8217;ve paid for them. &#8220;_

  * DRM systems are bad for business  
    > _&#8220;DRM is the software equivalent of (&#8230;) closed hardware interfaces&#8221;_

  * DRM systems are bad for artists  
    > _&#8220;Tech gives us bigger pies that more artists can get a bite out of. &#8220;_

  * DRM is a bad business-move for MSFT  
    > _&#8220;Like millions of other Microsoft customers, I want a player that plays anything I throw at it, and I think that you are just the company to give it to me. &#8220;_
