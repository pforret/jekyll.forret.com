> UPDATE Nov 2019: <strong>my idea has been validated</strong>! I just discovered a sleek aluminium version, called the <a href="https://linedock.co/products/macbook-13in-docking-station">LineDock</a>! Extra (USB/HDMI/DisplayPort) ports, extra battery power and up to 1TB of SSD disk space.

This is the story of how I made my own pretty bamboo _USB SSD disk expansion support_ for my laptop, hereby possibly inventing the gadget category &#8220;**disk expansion laptop coaster**&#8220;

As a photographer, I need a lot of storage space. As a [travelling photographer](https://tangopaparazzo.com), I also need it on my laptop. My current 13&#8243; MacBook Pro is plenty fast, but it only has a 512GB SSD drive. I quickly found out that is way too small. So I bought an external SSD disk. The Samsung Portable 500GB version is affordable and it&#8217;s almost as fast as the internal drive. But it&#8217;s only 500GB. So I bought a second and a third. Now, travelling with 3 USB disks and a USB hub (since my MBP only has 2 USB ports, and I need one for reading CompactFlash cards) is quite a hassle. There&#8217;s cables everywhere, you&#8217;re always afraid you&#8217;ll drop one, or forget one. So I decided to kind of tape them together.

After travelling for months with this beta version (made out of a plastic table cover and lots of tape), I decided to make a real one, a version 1.0. Here's what happened:

#### Step 1: buy 2 bamboo serving trays (26 euro, in [Blokker](http://www.blokker.be/nl/yong-dienblad-bamboe-32-x-24-x-1-7-cm))

#### Step 2: figure out how to fit a USB hub + 3 SSD disks inside

#### Step 3: cut out hole for the cable

To give you an idea of the price of this hardware:

* StarTech 4-port USB 3.0 hub: 30 euro @ [Coolblue](https://www.laptopshop.be/product/638976/startech-draagbare-4-poorts-superspeed-usb-3-0-hub-zwart.html)
* 3 x Samsung Portable SSD T3 500GB: 200 euro each @ [Coolblue](https://www.laptopshop.be/product/695603/samsung-portable-t3-500-gb.html)

#### Step 4: fix all hardware inside the bottom tray

#### Step 5: cover top tray with bubble paper

#### Step 6: glue two trays together

#### Step 7: remove excess glue and admire

### Possible improvements

* Size: once the 2TB SSD disks become affordable (now they&#8217;re still at 800 euro), I could build a 6TB version.
* Protection: for the moment each USB disk shows up as a separate disk. So I use 3 different Lightroom catalogs to manage that. Better would be to have a 3 SSD disk configuration in [USB RAID-5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dougISKs2vQ) protection: no data is lost when 1 disk goes bad, and you only see one big disk on your laptop
* Media: a logical extension would be to include a USB CompactFlash reader. I still need that for my Canon 5D cameras.
* USB-C: I think this would make it possible to also add extra batteries in the laptop coaster.
