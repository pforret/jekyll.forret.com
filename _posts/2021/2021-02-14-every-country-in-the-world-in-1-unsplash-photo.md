I wanted to demonstrate the power of my [splashmark](/2020/10/07/new-script-splashmark-easy-unsplash-image-markup-on-the-command-line/) image markup script and did the following experiment:

  * I got a list of all countries in the world (via [kalinchernev/countries](https://gist.github.com/kalinchernev/486393efcca01623b18d), but I cleaned it up a little)
  * for each country, my script searched for the most popular image in [**Unsplash**](https://unsplash.com/). E.g. for **Belgium**, it is a photo by Alex Vasey of the [city of **Dinant**](https://unsplash.com/photos/3lxrM5yvkcI) (almost 4 million views, 37000 downloads):<figure class="wp-block-image size-large">

{% include img.html

    href="https://unsplash.com/photos/3lxrM5yvkcI"
    description="Photo by Alex Vasey on Unsplash" %}

  * The script then used **splashmark** to resize and crop the original size of the image to a square 800&#215;800 size (&#8220;_Instagram style_&#8220;), added the name of the country as a big title, and added the photo attribution info (URL/photographer), _burnt_ into the photo (top and bottom right), as well as embedded in the image meta-data EXIF/IPTC info. This makes that attribution info pop up automatically when you use the photo in Facebook or WordPress, as you will see below.
  * The result is 195 images for 195 countries that should/could be representative for each. The definition of &#8220;most popular&#8221; image for Unsplash seems to be &#8220;most downloads&#8221;. 
  * **The end result is here: [github.com/pforret/&#8230;/countries.md](https://github.com/pforret/splashmark_examples/blob/main/countries/countries.md)**

I will give you some highlights:

## Tourism posters

A lot of countries are represented by exactly the image you'd expect. France: the Eiffel tower, Australia: the Opera house on Sydney, Japan: Mount Fuji &#8230;

## People

For some countries, the most popular Unsplash photo is a person.

## Random technology

Unsplash depends on the content provided by its photographers, and sometimes the most popular photo for a country has little to do with that country and more with the photographer who happened to provide the photo. E.g.: a Sony camera for Afghanistan, a Mi Note phone for Botswana, an old MacBook with a random website for Rwanda.

## Random military

I was surprised to find that the most popular Unsplash photo for Hungary was not of the Parliament in Budapest, not of the Balaton lake, but some military parade.

## Random nature

Nature can be beautiful, but sometime sit can also be very generic. Some countries have as most popular Unsplash photo a random piece of nature.

## View from above

It would be hard to choose a representative picture for a country like the USA, and the Unsplash community seems to have chosen a view from above: a picture from NASA.

## Conclusion

I enjoyed this experiment and will be doing more in the future. In the meantime, if you want to easily work with photos (your own or those from Unsplash) on the command-line, check out [splashmark](https://github.com/pforret/splashmark) on Github!
