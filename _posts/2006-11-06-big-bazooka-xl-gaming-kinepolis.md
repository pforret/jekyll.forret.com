Now you can a rent a movie theatre for a half hour to play [Playstation](http://www.playstation.com) games on the big screen in [Kinepolis](http://www.kinepolis.com) Brugge.

> Thanks to the widespread digitalisation of Kinepolis cinemas, Kinepolis is developing further &#8216;alternative content&#8217; in conjunction with [Barco](http://www.barco.com/digitalcinema) and [Technicolor](http://www.technicolor.com/Cultures/En-Us/Services/Digital/). In addition to digital full-length films, cinema-goers can now also experience more and more alternative content in digital format, such as prestigious events, television series, live concerts and sports competitions &#8211; and now [XL Gaming](http://www.kinepolis.com/xlgaming), too.

Imagine you could rent a movie theatre and show whatever you want, without the necessity of 35mm film, to a public of, let&#8217;s say, 20 to 50 people. What would you project?

  * movie DVD: classic movies that never get to the screen anymore, like &#8220;Spinal Tap&#8221;, &#8220;The Party&#8221;
  * music DVD: stuff like &#8220;Woodstock&#8221;, &#8220;Sade &#8211; Lovers Live&#8221;
  * series DVD: 3 seasons of &#8220;Friends&#8221; in a row, or series that never made it to Europe like &#8220;Curb Your Enthusiasm&#8221;
  * comedy DVD: a night full of Eddy Murphy, George Burns or Da Ali-G Show
  * documentary DVD: Carl Sagan or the BBC&#8217;s &#8220;A Brief History of Infinity&#8221;
  * Powerpoint presentations: if they add a crane, you can even do an &#8220;Al Gore&#8221; (cf &#8220;An Inconvenient Truth&#8221;)
  * software demos: e.g. Final Cut Pro, Second Life
  * live Skype session: with the webcam in that little top right 10m² block
  * &#8230;

What would you want to see on a huge screen like that?
