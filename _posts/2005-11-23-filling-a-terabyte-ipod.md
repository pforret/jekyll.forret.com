A 1000 GB iPod, that is

  * 200 movies or 370 hours of full quality DVD 
  * up to 2000 hours (almost 3 months non-stop) at DivX/Xvid/MPEG-4 quality 
  * using the [H.264 video](http://www.forret.com/tools/bandwidth.asp?speed=768&unit=Kbps&title=H.264%20video) compression: 120 days or 4 months of video! 
  * 1500 music albums of full quality CD (which means, no [Sony XCP](http://blog.forret.com/blog/2005/11/how-not-to-do-copy-protection-sony.html)) 
  * 15.000 albums if your rip/compress them to MP3 first, maybe 20.000 if you use WMA/AAC (that is over 2 years of audio to listen to!) 
  * 2500 episodes or 100 seasons of TV series like Lost, L-Word, Desperate Housewives, Sopranos, &#8230; in compressed format (hey, it&#8217;s a 2,5&#8243; screen, who cares about HD?) 
  * If your terabyte iPod breaks down and you buy a new one, it will take you between 3 hours ([FireWire 800 Mbps](http://www.forret.com/tools/bandwidth.asp?speed=800&unit=Mbps&title=Firewire%2D800+%5BIEEE1394%5D)) to 2 days ([Wifi 802.11g](http://www.forret.com/tools/bandwidth.asp?speed=54&unit=Mbps&title=802%2E11g+%5BWiFi%5D)) to fill it up again (from the backup you of course had put on your snug little home 10GB RAID-5 storage cluster thingy).  
    If by then all portable devices have [10-Gbit Ethernet](http://www.forret.com/tools/bandwidth.asp?speed=10&unit=Gbps&title=10+Gigabit+Ethernet+%5BLAN%5D) built in: 15 minutes will be enough to fill &#8216;er up. 
  * Our then-standard [48 megapixel camera](http://www.forret.com/tools/megapixel.asp?title=48+Megapixel+camera&width=8000&height=6000) would create 72MB RAW images, of which the iPod could store 14.000, or if you would compress them to 5MB JPEG: 200.000 pictures. 

Other predictions: the [iPhone](http://money.cnn.com/2005/11/11/technology/apple_predictions/) (or Apple as mobile virtual network operator) and the [iTIVO](http://money.cnn.com/2005/11/11/technology/apple_predictions/), a media-center/time-shifting/TV/video/DVD hub , all in the next 12-24 months. Let&#8217;s hope this inspires some people to seriously vamp up their design/user interface teams (Nokia, Microsoft, I&#8217;m looking at you!).
