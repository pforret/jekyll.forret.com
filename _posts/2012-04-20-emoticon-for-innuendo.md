Do you often find yourself in a situation where you are using some kind of word play in a written (chat or text message) conversation, but feel that you need to make this second level of comprehension clear? This is why **emoticons** exist: _pictorial representations of a facial expression using punctuation marks and letters, written to express a person&#8217;s mood_. [Emoticons](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emoticon) were already used in the 18th century and adopted with mucho gusto in electronic communication since 1982. These days, if you don&#8217;t know that a &#8220;:-)&#8221; means that the writer is happy, you&#8217;re missing a lot of the meaning of SMS or emails.

It doesn&#8217;t [stop there](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_emoticons), there is also the `:-p` _tongue-sticking-out_, the `%-)` _I&#8217;m-so-drunk_ and even `*<|:-)` _Santa Claus_. But there is one often-used ironical level that I find is not well covered by the `;-)` _I&#8217;m-only-joking_ emoticon, and that is the dangerous stylistical weapon called **innuendo**: _an indirect remark about somebody or something, usually suggesting something bad, mean or rude._ We need an emoticon that says _if-you-know-what-I-mean-wink-wink-[nudge-nudge](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nudge_Nudge)_ in 3 characters. I hereby propose the &#8230;

### &-)   = if-you-know-what-I-mean

<!--more-->

  * &#8220;_My parents are coming over tomorrow and I still have to dust off the silverware &-)_&#8221; = have to clean up dishes for the last 2 weeks and remove all clothes from the living room
  * &#8220;_Can&#8217;t talk right now, my girlfriend is here and we&#8217;re studying &-)_&#8221; = no actual studying is done
  * &#8220;I_s your wife a goer? &-)_&#8221; = say no more

What could be a proper response to a &-) ? Depending the recipient&#8217;s sense of humor:

  * `&-D` _oh-I-\*know\*-what-you-mean_
  * `&-O` _OMG-you-didn&#8217;t-just-say-that-did-you_
  * `&-?` _not-really-sure-what-you-mean_
  * `&-/` _I-get-it-but-am-not-that-amused_
  * `&-(` _this-is-totally-inappropriate-and-I-am-disappointed-in-you_

I think there is also one variation necessary for the [most versatile joke on earth](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=that's%20what%20she%20said): _that&#8217;s what she said_! This is expressed with `&-)!` &#8211; as in &#8220;_Are you in yet?_&#8221; > _&#8220;&-)!_&#8221;

And to end, I leave you with this: Uncyclopedia&#8217;s definition for [sexual innuendo](http://uncyclopedia.wikia.com/wiki/Sexual_innuendo). Just don&#8217;t read it aloud in the office.

TL;DR:
