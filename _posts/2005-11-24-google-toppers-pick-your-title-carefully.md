Everyone with a bit of SEO (Search Engine Optimalisation) experience knows that the `title` of your HTML pages is crucial. But just how strong is that tiny part of your HTML? When I noticed I had become #1 for the Google query &#8220;`media technology belgium`&#8221; in Google (3 words I put in my blog title), I started investigating a bit further. I was first in a total of 18 million pages (according to the &#8220;_of about_&#8221; part in the top right of each Google results page). Could I do better than that? I could -as can be seen lower- but there are much stronger examples from other blogs. 

Some remarks up front:

  * Keep in mind that [Google has indexed something like 15 billion pages](http://google.blognewschannel.com/index.php/archives/2005/01/23/google-at-how-many-billion-9-11/) so the theoretical walhalla of search results would be: `#1 of about 15.000.000.000 pages`. Impossible to reach of course (expect if Google would allow to search for the character &#8220;.&#8221; in an URL, e.g.) &#8211; but let&#8217;s see how close we get.
  * Search term combinations with e.g. the word &#8220;blog&#8221; will always be smaller than 512,000,000 since that is the # of pages in Google for &#8220;[blog](http://www.google.com/search?q=blog)&#8220;.
  * Sometimes the # of results for a query with 2 words returns less results that a query with the same 2 and 1 extra word. Does not make sense, but there results might come from 2 different servers/stat versions/indexes. 
  * All results below are subject to change. You might do the same query now and get another #1 or another total. It&#8217;s normal, Google is a huge beast that is always on the move.
