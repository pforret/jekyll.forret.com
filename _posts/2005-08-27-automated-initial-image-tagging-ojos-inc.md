What meta-data do we have for the average digital picture we take:

MINIMAL:</p> 
:   a **filename**, typically autogenerated by the camera (e.g. &#8220;DSC0009&#8221;) or chosen at the moment of import (e.g. &#8220;Trip to Portugal 001&#8221; or &#8220;Aug2005_001&#8221;) 
:   a **filedate**, which probably correponds to the date the picture landed on the hard disk 
:   **EXIF information**: date of image capture, camera brand and model, aperture, &#8230; (maybe in the future also geo-location from a built-in GPS)</p> 
    
    ADDED BY HUMAN HAND</p> 
    
    :   a **title** and a **description**: in free text 
    :   an **group/set/album** name: typically less than 10 words 
    :   **tags or labels**: the ideal search criteria, typically added by the owner 
    :   **geo coordinates**: the new craze on [Pixagogo](http://maps.pixagogo.com) (who then also add the city name as a tag), so the pictures can be mapped on Google Maps 

If the human-added metadata is missing, there is hardly a way to find the picture through [Google Images](http://images.google.com/) or [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/search/). What if there could be an software that analyzes a picture and automatically adds relevant metadata to a picture?

> Munjal Shah, onetime cofounder of the auction services firm Andale, finally let slip on his new blog what he&#8217;s been working on since leaving last year (&#8230;) In other words, his startup, tentatively named [Ojos](http://www.ojos-inc.com/) (Spanish for &#8220;eyes&#8221;), is creating a new way to search and organize photos.  
> (&#8230;) he revealed the key technologies behind Ojos: **face and text recognition**. (&#8230;) The other key: You can assign tags, or keywords, to one photo and the service will automatically append that tag to other photos of the same people.

I wonder if it also could be used to recognize familiar archetypes/icons like: a house, an sunset, an iPod, a Ferrari&#8230;

On his own blog, Shah writes:

> I think Flickr&#8217;s tag based system is just super (in fact I love it), but I wanted all of my photos on there, I wanted them all tagged, and I didn&#8217;t want to spend hundreds of hours doing it. So being the lazy engineers that we are, we thought maybe we can at least auto-tag some of the faces and names.

[Ho John Lee states on his blog](http://www.hojohnlee.com/weblog/?p=250) that the technology should be offered as a web service, not as yet another photo storage site. He has a point, and I can see also it working in a technology licensing model: let Flickr or Pixagogo run it locally and let them pay per million pictures treated. Anyway, it will be interesting to see where this company goes.
