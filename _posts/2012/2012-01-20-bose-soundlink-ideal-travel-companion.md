Thanks to the nice people at [Bose Belgium](http://www.bosebelgium.be), I have been using the [Bose Soundlink](http://www.engadget.com/2011/09/15/bose-unveils-soundlink-wireless-mobile-speaker-fancies-up-a2dp/) for a couple of weeks, and when I left for a trip to Buenos Aires last month, I thought: why not take it along? After all, it&#8217;s only 1.3kg and it could give me some better sound in the hotel. I did not regret it.

First of all it&#8217;s fully wireless: the Soundlink works on long-lasting batteries and gets its music over Bluetooth easily up to 10 meters away. It&#8217;s really light, so you really carry it with you without thinking too much. Any time I get back to my room, I just press the![](http://t1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcReETPMJkZPhE5qmy56gCjBGLcLLWYBiVFf35I6k8RjHWMFnIcO) icon on the speaker and it reconnects to my iPhone. I take it to the kitchen, the terrace on the rooftop, and it just keeps playing, even when I leave the iPhone in my room.

Most importantly: the sound is impressive. Everyone who heard my Soundlink was really impressed and started asking me for technical -and financial- details. Now, at 300â‚¬, it&#8217;s not exactly cheap, but it&#8217;s worth all that.

For all the &#8216;gadgets&#8217; I use, I ask myself: does it make my life more enjoyable (for a reasonable price)? For the Bose Soundlink, that&#8217;s a definite &#8216;Yes&#8217;.
