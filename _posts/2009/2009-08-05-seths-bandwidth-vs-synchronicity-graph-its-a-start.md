Seth Godin came up with a visualisation of &#8216;means of communication': [bandwidth vs sync](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2009/08/the-bandwidth-sync-correlation-thats-worth-thinking-about.html)(chronicity). He took a number of &#8216;old' (postal mail, radio) and &#8216;new' (blogs, Youtube and -of course- Twitter) technologies and ranked them on a 2D graph according to &#8216;quality' (density or bandwidth) and &#8216;sync' (speed of reaction).

Although it is an interesting way of visualizing things, and I consider Seth a very bright and creative guy, I am bothered by the fact that the graph is neither clear, correct nor complete.

<!--more-->NOT CLEAR

  * I have the impression that the horizontal axis of synchronous/asynchronous in the graph is a fuzzy concept. What is it actually? The average time between the creating of the message and the reception thereof? Or between the sending and the receving of a response? Radio is totally synchronous in its transmission but is very one-to-many: you can't easily react nor are you expected to. I would like an axis with a unit of measure. Is it expressed in time (seconds/hours/days)? Wouldn't a measure of one-to-one vs one-to-many be a more appropriate axis?
  * Also the bandwidth axis is not clearly defined. Is it something like Kbps/Mbps for 1 individual message? Or is it the average size of 1 message? Is is the bandwidth from the point of view of the creator (writing one Tweet of 140 chars every hour) or that of the consumer (getting 20 Tweets a minute from all your Twitter friends)?

NOT CORRECT

  * Why are IM (chatting) and SMS (texting) taken as one? They are different in bandwidth (SMS are shorter and take longer to write) and in synchronicity (chatting is a faster medium: you type with a real keyboard).
  * How can you put the whole of &#8216;art' as one data point? Theatre? Painting? Music?
  * Most of all: **what is Twitter doing in that &#8216;hot spot' on the right bottom**? Twitter is low bandwidth, yes, but not lower than texting, and it is maybe fast but still asynchronous, so should certainly be to the left of IM/chat. It seems like Twitter is there because it would be so cool to have it exactly there.

NOT COMPLETE

  * podcasts, as it would be nice to see where to put them compared to &#8216;talk radio'.
  * Skype (conf) call with video?
  * Fax/Telex/VHS/DVD
  * Email can be one-to-one (like chat but more asynchronous) or one-to-many (newsletter, close to talk radio). Are both uses considered the same?

One can't post a reply on Seth's blog, and I'd like the graph to mature a bit. I think that with some better definition of axis and data points it will be  a good way to categorize means of communication. And I'm certainly interested to see what it will look like then.
