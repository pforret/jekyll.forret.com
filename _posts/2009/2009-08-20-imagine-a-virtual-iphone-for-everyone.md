I was downloading a free iPhone app at noon, and I thought: some of these applications have no good alternative in the browser world. Imagine everyone could start using/buying the Apple iPhone/iPod Touch applications right in their browser. You give your Apple ID, you purchase an app like [ColorSplash](http://www.juxtaposer.info/ColorSplash.html) and off you go. Some of the multi-touch interface would be hard to emulate, but still. It would have to be an Apple application that does it: like e.g. iTunes. It&#8217;s got your Apple ID anyway. Why not run a virtual iPod Touch in there?

The advantages:

  * some applications for iPhone/iPod just have no worthy counterpart in the &#8216;normal&#8217; world.
  * an application would run immediately on Apple MacOSX as well as Windows XP/Vista/7
  * the iPhone developers wouldn&#8217;t be looking anymore at a potential audience of some X million iPhone owners, but at all iTunes owners.

> _Research analyst Sam Bhavnani, of the market research firm Current Analysis, says that iTunes has 200 million users. Research analyst Shaw Wu, of the market research firm American Technology Research, gives a figure of 100 million. Oddly, Apple itself gives a much lower number: 10 million._
