I&#8217;ve had my iPhone for a week (loving it!) and of course I want to make custom ring tones for some of my contacts. I figured out how it worked from posts like [create-free-iphone-ringtones-using-itunes-in-windows](http://create-free-iphone-ringtones-using-itunes-in-windows/) but I developed my own workflow:

**1. Find a source file**

  * I typically start from an existing MP3 file. It might be a CD I have ripped to MP3, or a soundtrack from DVDs or other sound bites. I also have a collection of accapella samples that are a nice source.

**2. Create the 15 &#8211; 30 sec tone in MP3 format**

  * You don&#8217;t need a 5 min ringtone, just 15 to 30 seconds will be enough
  * I use [Audacity](http://audacity.sourceforge.net/) (with the [LAME MP3 encoder add-on](http://audacity.sourceforge.net/help/faq?s=install&item=lame-mp3)) to load the full source MP3 file, trim out the piece I want and then add a fade-in and fade-out.

**3. Export to MP3**

  * I then export the file to an MP3 file of 128kbps. You don&#8217;t need better quality than that anyway. If you want, you can convert the file to mono here, or it can happen in the next step
  * Result: ringtone.mp3

**4. Convert with ffmpeg to MPEG4 ringtone**

  * I prefer using the command-line [ffmpeg](http://ffmpeg.mplayerhq.hu/) for transcoding of audio and video.
  * The simple way of doing it: `ffmpeg -i ringtone.mp3 -y ringtone.m4a` (.m4a stands for MPEG4 audio, ffmpeg will see this extension and use default settings for the conversion.) Afterwards you then have to change the extension to .m4r (MPEG4 ringtone).
  * The detailed one-step-only way to do this: `ffmpeg.exe -i ringtone.mp3 -ac 1 -ab 128000 -f mp4 -acodec libfaac -y ringtone.m4r`

**5. Open file with iTunes**

  * Just double-click the file, that should do it.

**The lazy way:**

let&#8217;s make a batch file that will automatically convert the first 30 seconds of any MP3 file into an iPhone ringtone:  
`SET INPUT=%1<br />
SET NAME=%INPUT:.mp3=%<br />
SET OUTPUT=%NAME%.m4r<br />
echo CONVERT %INPUT% to %OUTPUT% ...<br />
ffmpeg.exe -i %INPUT% -t 30 -ac 1 -ab 128000 -f mp4 -acodec libfaac -genre Ringtone -y %OUTPUT%`
