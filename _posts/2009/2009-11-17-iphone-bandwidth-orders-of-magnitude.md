[<img  style="display: inline; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; border: 0px;" title="04112009175905[1]" src="http://blog2.forret.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/041120091759051_thumb1.jpg" alt="04112009175905[1]" width="171" height="244" align="right" border="0" />](http://blog2.forret.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/0411200917590511.jpg)I did a bandwidth test the other day with the iPhone [SpeedTest](http://www.speedtest.net/) tool. I wanted to compare the speed using (standard) GPRS, using 3G and my own Wifi. The results were all a power of ten apart:

  * iPhone on Proximus GPRS: **35 kbps** (download & upload)
  * iPhone on Proximus 3G: **350 kbps** (download & upload)
  * iPhone via Wifi: **3500 kbps** (download – upload is +- 300 kbps)

&nbsp;

The real reason is that I wanted to see how fast I would wear out my [Proximus data plan](http://customer.proximus.be/en/Mobile_Internet_Smartphone/MIS_Mobile_Internet.html) (200MB per month). The answer: with GPRS I would need more than 12 hours of continuous downloading, with 3G I could do it in less than 2 hours. So GPRS is pretty safe, it’s also easier on your battery, but you have to live with slow, pre-1996 modem-like performance. The latency – the time it takes to get your first byte after requesting a URL &#8211;  is easily 10 to 50 seconds. Not milliseconds, seconds!

&nbsp;

As a side note: do not take a time-based data subscription, certainly not with the iPhone. My first post-iPhone Proximus invoice was 800,- euro, **which is more than the price of my iPhone**! When I contacted them about that, they immediately offered to reimburse it and advised me to switch to a size-based plan. I guess I was not the first one …
