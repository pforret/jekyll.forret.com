I&#8217;m doing more and more Laravel development and I&#8217;m hosting these projects on Gandi.net Simple Hosting. I&#8217;ve also switched completely to Gandi&#8217;s **deploy with git** method, since it lets me do full and easy deployment from my laptop&#8217;s command line. I&#8217;ve even created a [bash script `gdeploy.sh`](https://github.com/pforret/gandi_deploy) to make this faster, Let me explain how it works:<figure class="wp-block-image size-large">

  1. when you [start your project](https://blog.forret.com/2020/03/05/hosting-a-laravel-project-on-gandi/), add the `git remote` for gandi, as specified in your Gandi Simple Hosting dashboard 
  2. develop and run your project locally (using e.g. `php artisan serve`)
  3. when you want to deploy, you commit the changes to the master branch
      * `git commit -a`
  4. you then push the changes to the Gandi git server
      * `git push gandi master`
  5. you then start deployment from the Gandi git server to the web server. This will also do a `composer install` (if there is a composer.lock file) and a `npm install` (if there is a package-lock.json file)
      * `ssh <id>@<gitserver> deploy <website>.git`

I have multiple Gandi Simple Hosting servers and I found it confusing to keep track of what server I was supposed to deploy to for each site. So I developed **[gandi_deploy](https://github.com/pforret/gandi_deploy)**. This is how that works:

## Installation

  * what should already be installed: `git` (obviously), [`cli.gandi.net`](https://cli.gandi.net/)
  * clone this repository somewhere on your machine  
    `git clone https://github.com/pforret/gandi_deploy.git`
  * from any of your Gandi git-managed project, add a symbolic link to gdeploy.sh  
    `ln -s /path/to/gandi_deploy/gdeploy.sh .`
  * initialise the script for your project, type the domain name of your site if it cannot be guessed from the folder name  
    `./gdeploy.sh <strong>init</strong>`
  * this will retrieve the correct git server, web server, user name for this website and store them locally in a hidden folder `.gandi`.

## Easy deployment

  * my most common usage is: `./gdeploy.sh <strong>all</strong>`: this does all 3 steps: commit-push-deploy one after the other, It might take more than 30 secs, but I just have to wait for it to finish.
  * I can also choose to run them one by one: 
      * `./gdeploy.sh <strong>commit</strong>` will do the local git commit
      * `./gdeploy.sh <strong>push</strong>` will push the new commit to the Gandi git server
      * `./gdeploy.sh <strong>deploy</strong>` will push new commit to the Gandi web server,
  * for non-Laravel PHP sites, when there is no `php artisan serve`, I can start a local webserver with `./gdeploy.sh <strong>serve</strong>` (on port 8000) or `./gdeploy.sh <strong>rnd</strong>` (on a random port between 8000 and 8099). It uses the PHP built-in server.
  * to login to the remote SSH serve, I can use `./gdeploy.sh <strong>ssh</strong>`. This uses `gandi paas remote` to start the SSH access.
  * for sites where I have a staging server and a production server, I can define different remotes (`git remote add stage ...`) and then use `./gdeploy.sh <strong>push stage</strong>` or `./gdeploy.sh <strong>push prod</strong>` to choose where I&#8217;m pushing the code,

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
  <p>
    <strong>./gdeploy.sh all</strong>
  </p>
  
  <cite>to commit, push and deploy new code to Gandi, in 1 go</cite>
</blockquote>
