I started to do some QR code experiments recently and this is the first result of this: my animated QR code, &#8216;**QR Roulette**&#8216; or **_QRoulette_**.

First the basics: a [QR code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code) is a 2-dimensional barcode format. It&#8217;s a way to encode data (like a URL, a business card or just any text) into something that can be printed or shown on a screen, so that a QR code reader (your smartphone&#8217;s camera is probably one) can read the code and get the data out of it. It is _visual wireless data transfer_. The more data, the bigger the QR code becomes.<figure class="wp-block-gallery columns-2 is-cropped">

{% include image.html url="https://blog.forret.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/long.png" description="a long text in QR code" %}

What I have developed is: 
an animated series of different QR-encoded URLs, 
changing slow enough that a simple QR reader (like your smartphone camera) will recognise them most of the time 
but fast enough that you can&#8217;t really be sure which one you&#8217;re going to get when you click the URL. 
Hence: **QR Roulette**

In the above example, all the URLs are Youtube URLs. 
An iPhone needs up to a second to 'find' a QR code, and the different codes are changing at 2x/second, 
so there is no telling which one you will get.

### Toolchain

  * I did my first QR code experiments in bash, with [`qrencode`](https://linux.die.net/man/1/qrencode) and [imagemagick](https://imagemagick.org/)
  * I have now created a web service in [Laravel](https://laravel.com/), using [BaconQRCode](https://github.com/Bacon/BaconQrCode) for making the QR codes and my own wrapper around ImageMagick&#8217;s command-line `convert`, because the popular packages like [Intervention/image](https://github.com/Intervention/image) don&#8217;t support all the effects I needed (transparency, masking, animated gif etc).

### Other animated QR codes

I am obviously not the first person who thinks of animating QR codes. There are already other kinds of animated QR codes: 

  * there is [QR4 with their animation inside a static QR](https://blog.qr4.nl/Animated-QR-Code.aspx)

  * there is [TXQR](https://github.com/divan/txqr) with streaming data transfer via animated QR
