I saw I was getting quite some traffic from Russia on my [tech news aggregator](https://nuuz.io/tech). It turns out I have a Russian site that [published a post on nuuz.io](https://vas3k.ru/blog/2019/#scroll390). I made it onto their &#8216;Web projects of the year 2019&#8217; list, next to [Nomadlist](https://nomadlist.com/) and Deepl.

    A little page collected by a random dude from the Internet replaced all the news sites for me this year. A quick reading of the headlines once a week was enough to stay on top of all the trends, and tops HackerNews, Reddit, ProductHunt and Medium constantly brought something interesting to read.

It&#8217;s a pretty interesting site, actually: IT salaries, travel, computational photography. It even has a Russian version of XKCD cartoons.<figure class="wp-block-image size-large">
