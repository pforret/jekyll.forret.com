See this photo below? It was created with one, albeit rather long, command line:

![](/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/splashmark.jpg)


```
splashmark -w 1280 -c 640 -i github.com/pforret/splashmark -j 50 \
   -e dark,grain -3 "created with pforret/splashmark" \
   -p fonts/FiraCode-Regular.ttf search splashmark.jpg splash
```

The **[splashmark](https://github.com/pforret/splashmark) script** searches for &#8220;splash&#8221; on Unsplash.com, downloads the first photo found, resizes it to 1280 pixels width, crops it to 640 pixels height, uses a &#8216;dark&#8217; and a &#8216;grain&#8217; filter, adds a big title in the middle and photo URL and Unsplash attribution in the corners, using the Google font Fira. It takes about 10 seconds,

Another example?

I developed splashmark because I needed a different picture for each page of a site I was building, 
and I found myself doing too many steps for each photo. 
It can be used to make title images, social images, inspirational quotes &#8230; etc.

The script was created with [bashew](https://github.com/pforret/bashew), my bash script boilerplate generator. Make a script in minutes, not hours.<figure class="wp-block-image size-large">
