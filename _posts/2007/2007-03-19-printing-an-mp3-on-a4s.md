Look wat &#8216;experts&#8217; are still telling in the courtroom:

> The HP Pavilion computer obtained from McGuire&#8217;s attorney&#8217;s office had a 60 gigabyte hard drive, and not all of it was searched by Seymour.  
> She told the jury that it is known in the computer industry that if information stored on a 12 gigabyte computer _was put on paper it would create a stack of paper higher than the Empire State Building_.

There was a time once when PCs were just overevolved typewriters and it made sense to express everything in &#8220;number of pages&#8221;. That time has long gone. Let&#8217;s convert that 12 GB into today&#8217;s storage currencies:

  * 12 GB is the equivalent of 17 CD-ROMs of data (700MB)
  * not yet 3 full DVDs (4.7GB) 
  * Not even _one_ HD-DVD (15/30GB) or Blu-Ray (25/50GB) disc
  * 4000 3MB (+-8 megapixel) pictures in JPG format
  * 12 days of MP3 recordings (at [96Kbps](http://web.forret.com/tools/bandwidth.asp?speed=96&unit=Kbps&title=MP3+Medium+%5BAudio%5D))
  * 16 episodes (not even one full season) of Lost, Prison Break or Heroes

Moreover, a conversion to typed-out A4s only makes sense if you specify font-size, spacing, margins and usage of duplex printing, in which case it remains an impractical antiquated unit.

A jury full of technophobes/non-experts shouldn&#8217;t be baffled with exaggerations like a &#8220;tower the size of the Empire State&#8221;. If you do not take into account the operating system, programs, images, music and movies, what remains on a hard disk of searchable data created by the owner? Maybe 2-5 gigabytes, thanks to MS Office&#8217;s bloated file formats. And the most important stuff for computer forensics is maybe 5MB: browser history, cookies, IM transcripts, emails and Office documents converted to text.
