[<img  style="float: right" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1045/735045873_2b654283e4_m.jpg" width="102" height="240" alt="LG KU800 phone" />](http://www.flickr.com/photos/pforret/735045873/ "Photo Sharing") Because the posts on disappointing hardware are very popular on my blog (e.g. [Netgear storage](http://blog.forret.com/2006/07/netgear-sc-101-urgent-support-required/) and [Lexmark printer](http://blog.forret.com/2006/02/lexmark-printers-with-hardware-error-0502/)), I&#8217;d like to write about a device that also should be avoided: the [LG KU800 GSM](http://be.lge.com/ne/proddivergent.do?actType=search&categoryId=0702&modelCategoryId=&parentId=07). The KU800 is the Vodafone version of the KG800, which is [sold in Belgium by Proximus](http://live.proximus.be/nl/Vodafone/Devices/DEV_LGKu800.html) (239&euro;).

It was chosen by someone close to me for its neat black design, somewhat iPod-cool, let&#8217;s say. The design turned out to be the only thing it&#8217;s got going for it. The battery performance is lousy and almost every conversation of more than 5 minutes is broken of. She complained and got a replacement phone: exactly the same performance. A colleague of her also has that phone: the battery won&#8217;t even hold a full day.

The GSM forums talk about the same behaviour: 

  * [gsmarena.com](http://www.gsmarena.com/lg_ku800-reviews-1744.php): &#8220;it freezes up all the time, especially when im texting&#8221;, &#8220;the screen goes blank.. the camera freezes&#8230; i cant hear people on the other end&#8230; and oh the battery sucks&#8221;, &#8220;the display blocks when I slide it open , the touch pad started to fail sometimes and it has a very low speaker, i can hardly hear what the people i speak to are saying.&#8221;
  * [yourmobilephonereviews.co.uk](http://www.yourmobilephonereviews.co.uk/lg_ku800_reviews.htm): &#8220;The battery life is appalling&#8221;, &#8220;Most of the time the buttons don&#8217;t work &#8220;, &#8220;the phone volume itself is quiet even on the full setting, battery life is rubbish&#8221;, &#8220;I am now on my 4th one they all have the same problem. It just decides when it wants to turn on or off. The screen freezes, & the vibrate mode gets stuck&#8221;

Why can&#8217;t there be a phone with great design and the performance and reliability of a Ericsson/Nokia phone? Why is there no designer on the level of [Jonathan Ive](http://www.designmuseum.org/design/jonathan-ive) working at Nokia? Maybe that is a good question for [Bob Cringely](http://www.pbs.org/cringely/pulpit/2007/pulpit_20070705_002421.html).
