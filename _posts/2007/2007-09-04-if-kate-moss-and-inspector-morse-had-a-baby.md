Ok, she's not Kate Moss, and he's not Inspector Morse, but you get the general idea. If you father a child once you're past 70 years old, the kid's gonna have bags under the eyes.

On a totally unrelated note: thanks for all the nice emails, SMSes, IM's and other Facebook pokes I received for my 38th birthday. If I didn't reply immediately: I had a wonderful weekend with the woman I love. IÂ can only hope the rest of the year will continue on the same elan.
