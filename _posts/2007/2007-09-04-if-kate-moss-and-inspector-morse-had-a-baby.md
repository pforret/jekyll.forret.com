Ok, she&#8217;s not Kate Moss, and he&#8217;s not Inspector Morse, but you get the general idea. If you father a child once you&#8217;re past 70 years old, the kid&#8217;s gonna have bags under the eyes.

On a totally unrelated note: thanks for all the nice emails, SMSes, IM&#8217;s and other Facebook pokes I received for my 38th birthday. If I didn&#8217;t reply immediately: I had a wonderful weekend with the woman I love. IÂ can only hope the rest of the year will continue on the same elan.
