This is part of a series of posts on [weekday colors](/tag/ayurveda/).

## Saturday: black

> Saturday: If you are besieged by nagging interminable legal problems, launch an all out effort to resolve the problem on Saturdays. Any work initiated in the first half on Saturday carries a high possibility of success. Anyone leading a pious lifestyle on the day (...), keeping purple flowers at home and wearing black clothes, is likely to receive success and blessings of Shani or Saturn.
