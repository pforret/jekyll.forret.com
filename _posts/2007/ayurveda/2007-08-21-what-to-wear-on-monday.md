What color should you wear on Mondays, according to the Ayurveda?

## Monday: white

> Lord Shiva rules on Mondays. <strong>White</strong> is the color for Mondays and therefore wearing white dresses and keeping white flowers at home are recommended on Mondays. It is a good day for men seeking favors from women and for making new friends. Taking honey and cucumber on Mondays is likely to yield good results.
