Something I threw together, just because I could: [Twitter Quotient indicator](http://web.forret.com/tools/twitter-tq.asp?name=pforret). This page will get your # of friends, followers, favorites and updates from [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com) and calculate some ratios. The result might be confronting, disappointing or slightly funny. You choose.
