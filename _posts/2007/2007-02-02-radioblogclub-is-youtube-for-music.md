That you could use a simple copy/paste procedure to put a music player in your web pages? Well, there is. I&#8217;ve started using the Radio.Blog.Club player for my [Sample Spotters blog](http://www.xampled.com/blog/) and it&#8217;s proven to be as convenient as Youtube.

Radio.Blog.Club is a french project that works differently from YouTube. The music is not hosted by them, but by individuals. You can install the Radio.blog.player, which allows you to &#8216;convert&#8217; your music (it actually creates MP3 files at 64kbps with the LAME encoder, but calls them .rbs files) and then stream them from your own site in a playlist. The clever thing now is that Radio.Blog aggregates all these playlists and allows you to search from a central place. You can then listen to individuals songs (streamed from their respective hosts) or get the copy/paste HTML code to include them in your own blog/site. So they give you access to the music, but they don&#8217;t actually host the files, which puts them in a better position against the RIAA. They also have the RadioBlog store where you can buy music (through Amazon).

Some examples:

      Sometimes they even have some rather obscure music like this song by <a href="http://blog.forret.com/2006/11/babel-japanese-september-remix/">Shinichi Osawa</a>
