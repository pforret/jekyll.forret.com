Whether [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com) will turn out to be a conversational revolution or a giant waste of time, I&#8217;m still not sure about. Sometimes it feels like instant messaging (chatting \*with\* someone), sometimes like just changing the subtitle of your MSN/Gtalk (just a shout, no specific destination), sometimes it&#8217;s more like talking to yourself. But make no mistake: you are _not_ just talking to yourself!

Thanks to its huge geek-appeal (over 145.000 backlinks in Technorati), Twitter is well on its way towards a respectable [PageRank 8](http://livepr.raketforskning.com/?u=twitter%2Ecom). Twitter also uses pretty URLs, (twitter.com/[user]/statuses/[messageid] ), which Google likes a lot. Twitter also generously links from one account to the other (Twitter Friends). And Twitter has a LOT of (small bites of) content. As a result of that, whatever you say in Twitter may come back to haunt you through Google.

Exhibit 1: [Pietel](http://www.pietel.be)

When you do a Google search for &#8220;Pietel&#8221;, his Twitter account shows up as result #4 of 226.000. Being the good boy that he is, he just wrote that he finished his work assignment at home. But if his last remark would have been: &#8220;`stupid job, silly colleagues, moron boss`&#8220;, would he like that to show up on Google?  
_(depending on what Google server you fall, your results might be different, but the Twitter result has a good chance of ending up on the first page of results)._

Exhibit 2: [Clopin](http://www.clopin.be)  
[<img  src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/248/456467740_0f5981ae71.jpg" width="500" height="362" alt="Twitter exhibit 2: Clopin" />](http://www.flickr.com/photos/pforret/456467740/ "Photo Sharing")  
Even worse here: the Twitter account of Clopin shows up as site #2 for a search on his alias. And it includes one of his last remarks on Roos Van Acker&#8217;s early oral exercises with a carrot. Which, if he would end up working for SBS/VT4 at some point, or if his boss turns out to be Roos&#8217; jealous boyfriend without a sense of humour, might get him into trouble.

So I&#8217;m just saying: Twitter projects a false impression of a conversation amongst friends, and you might be tempted to say stuff a bit more harsh than you mean it. Which is why I use the &#8220;private&#8221; setting now on my Twitter account:
