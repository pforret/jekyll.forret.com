If you take a low-res picture, and you want to blow it up to a higher size, there are different algorithms to do the calculation of all those new pixels. I talked about this earlier in &#8220;[How to upsize an image](http://blog.forret.com/2006/08/how-to-upsize-an-image/)&#8220;. I went a bit further now and took a 100&#215;100 pixels detail of a [Roos Van Acker](http://www.filipnaudts.be/htmlsite/roos1.html) picture by [Filip Naudts](http://www.filipnaudts.be/) and enlarged it five times: to 500&#215;500. The tool I use, [Irfanview](http://www.irfanview.com), has 6 algorithms to do resize:

Contrary to what I expected, it was not the [Lanczos](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lanczos_algorithm) filter (slowest and &#8216;best&#8217;) that gave the best results, but the [B-spline algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spline_interpolation) that&#8217;s supposedly a bit worse. With Lanczos you get an rastering effect (check her hair), with B-spline it&#8217;s more even.

If you look at the simulation I made earlier, you see that B-spline blurs out the picture more evenly.

Lanczos creates these circular artefacts around magnification by 8 or 16.

I will do some tests on magnification of high-resolution photos to _super-high resolution_: e.g. from a 6 megapixel picture to 150 megapixel (width and height x 5 like above). I have a feeling the artefacts of areas that have less entropy/complexity (a 100&#215;100 pixel area might contain only some hairs of the eyebrows instead of a full face) will be different. Why would you want to create a picture bigger than 10 megapixel? An 8-megapixel should not be printed larger than 21.8&#8243; (553mm) x 16.3&#8243; (415mm) at 150dpi. With a 25 megapixel image, you can go to 38.5&#8243; (978mm) x 28.9&#8243; (734mm).
