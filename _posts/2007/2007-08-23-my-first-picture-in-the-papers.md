[An Baccaert](http://multiblog.vrt.be/anbaccaert/) wrote an article in De Morgen about Nathalie and Andrés, who are [representing the Benelux](http://www.milonga.be/2007/08/nathalie-andres-in-buenos-aires/) in the &#8216;_[Mundial de Tango](http://www.mundialdetango.gov.ar/index_e.php)_&#8216; in Buenos Aires. She wanted a nice picture to include with the article and came across [one I made at the Tango Marathon](http://www.flickr.com/photos/pforret/541437641/in/set-72157600341420464/) in June.

She asked me if she could use it, and because An is a friend of mine, because I know Nathalie, because I use a Creative Commons license and maybe also a bit because I like the idea of having an image of mine in the papers, I agreed. So there it is: my first newspaper publication!
