[<img src="http://www.carreconfiture.be/bwards/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/banner.jpg" style="float: right" alt="Bwards" />](http://bwards.carreconfiture.be/)**Too many URLs**  
I&#8217;d list everyone I&#8217;ve talked to yesterday, if only I could remember. Some random memories: [Dramoghe](http://dramoghe.wordpress.com/) is a girl, [Hendrik](http://www.studiomuscle.com/blog/) has a beard, [Sven](http://www.adhese.be) has a nice blogless girlfriend ([enchant&eacute;](http://www.adhese.com/enchante/)!), [LittleQ](http://www.eskimokaka.be) is about my size without her shoes, [Onnozelaar](http://onnozelheidmag.wordpress.com/) thought my age was 28 (thanks, but you should see me on the painting in the attic) and we ate looooooots of [Crokidos](http://www.crokidos.be/)!

**Animation**  
1) a singer: I was drinking. 2) standup comedy: I was talking. 3) rappers: I was hanging out with [Ine](http://www.monuments.nu) and Lien. There was one video of the [Stew](http://www.stew.be) crew that I appreciated a lot:  
  
How Twogirls, Dramoghe, KleineKeizerin, Onnozelaar are all created by one guy, a certain Abel Ransbottyn.

We weren&#8217;t looking at people&#8217;s faces.

**DJ Peter**  
The only reason why any (straight) guy would DJ is to make the pretty girls dance, and according to that standard my DJ set from 00h-01h was a success. I started with a mashup but dived right into a box full of funk, disco and R&B. I was rewarded with luscious moves by [Fire](http://vuur.wordpress.com/2007/03/24/bwards-afterglow-ofte-linkliefde/), [LittleEmpress](http://kleinekeizerin.blogspot.com/) and [Tantieris](http://tantieris.blogspot.com/2007/03/bwards.html), with the odd [BaldDrop](http://druppels.be/) thrown in. Had a great time!
