[<img  width="240" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2023/1617099492_01a17a2b62_m.jpg" alt="Shaky Logitech" height="208" style="float: right" />](http://www.flickr.com/photos/pforret/1617099492/ "Photo Sharing") I have wanted to buy a keyboard with Bulgarian layout for a while, and as you can imagine, you don&#8217;t find these in the local FNAC or Vandenborre. So when I saw that the [Logitech site](http://www.logitech.be) allowed purchasing online, of such exotic items like a Bulgarian keyboard, I quickly ordered one. However, the experience has been unsatisfactory:

  * First try: I order the keyboard, do the checkout procedure, pay with credit-card and get an immediate reaction: purchase OK, shipment will follow soon. Wow, that&#8217;s slick. Several days later, UPS passes by my front door while I&#8217;m not there, they say, the package is signed off by a certain &#8220;Korenberg&#8221; and I get an email: delivery OK. Slight alarm bell: I know no &#8220;Korenberg&#8221; living at my appartment. When I get home this is confirmed: no one in the building knows anyone by that name. Keyboard is in the twilight zone. I file complaint with Logitech, they propose refund, I accept, I&#8217;m still waiting for confirmation. But, I still need a BG keyboard.
  * Second try: I order another keyboard and try to pay with my credit card. Twice I give my credit card details, press &#8220;Process&#8221; and get redirected to the same check-out page, without any notion of whether or not my order is accepted. I check the &#8220;order history&#8221;, see that my recent purchase is not there and decide to give up on credit cards.
  * I select &#8220;bank payment&#8221; and finish checkout. They tell me what bank account I should pay on (one of [Bibit](http://www.bibit.com/)), and with which message. I do the payment, see that the number message is not a structured number (&#8220;gestructureerde mededeling&#8221;) and put it in the normal message box. Since then, nothing. Has Bibit recognized the money as the payment for Logitech? No idea. Has Logitech started fulfillment? I guess not.
  * I visit the Logitech web site again, checking out the Squeezebox, and decide to test the checkout system again. I put a Squeezebox in my shopping cart. When I go to the customer care, I fly from shop.logitech.com (where I am logged in) to logitech-nl-emea.custhelp.com (which looks the same, but where another login is necessary, because both accounts aren&#8217;t linked, apparently). There I get into an [eternal redirection loop](http://www.logitech.com/index.cfm/support/home/0/0,CRID=271?p_sid=Ui1oFuOi&p_accessibility=0&p_redirect=&cl=BE), with an infinite number of &#8220;`&cl=BE,nl`&#8221; adding themselves to the URL.
  * I try to break out of that loop by going back to the shopping cart page. For some reason my shopping cart now contains 2 Squeezeboxes instead of one. That&#8217;s it , I&#8217;ve had it.

Bottom line: this online shop of theirs is as trustworthy as Lindsay Lohan saying she&#8217;s gonna stop drinking. I buy online a lot from shops like Amazon andÂ Pixmania, so I think I&#8217;m qualified to say that their shopping application stinks. I&#8217;m gonna wait until next week for reply on the second purchase, if there&#8217;s none, I&#8217;m cancelling that order, and I&#8217;m never shopping with Logitech again.
