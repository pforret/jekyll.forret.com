[<img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/158/414543758_40509521fc.jpg" style="float: right" width="200" alt="Eva Mendes" />](http://www.flickr.com/photos/pforret/414543758/ "Photo Sharing") I wanted to see a movie this weekend and when I discovered at the counter that my first choice &#8220;[Night at the museum](http://imdb.com/title/tt0477347/)&#8221; was dubbed in French, the only other option was &#8220;[Ghost Rider](http://imdb.com/title/tt0259324/)&#8220;. That&#8217;s how I ended up in a movie that I actually hadn&#8217;t planned on seeing. The movie features Nicholas Cage and Eva Mendes and can be summarized in two words: fire and cleavage. Cage plays a Marvel Comics superhero on a seriously pimped up bike, who&#8217;s main characteristics would be superforce, a really low voice and being on fire. Mendes plays the girlfriend, with seriously pimped up boobs.

> &#8220;The original Roxanne was blonde and blue-eyed, but she also had huge bajoongasâ€¦ I figured since I can&#8217;t be blond and blue-eyed, I&#8217;ll at least have her bra size. So the bajoongas got big: they were out of control.&#8221;

If you&#8217;re a demanding movie-goer, don&#8217;t see this one. The bad acting is not fully evened out by the abundant cleavage. But try to use the word &#8220;Bajoongas&#8221; at least once in the next week. You&#8217;ll love the way it bounces in your mouth.
