This is what a YouTube clip page looks like now:

And this is what YouTube is developing as a new &#8216;beta&#8217; version:

  * they got rid of the large banner (&#8221; Use Quicklists!&#8221;) which was basically a waste of space.
  * all clip info is now under the video instead of to the right. All info on and action on a video are now in one place. I like it.
  * Youtube likes you to check out other videos. Most newly freed space is dedicated to thumbnails of other (&#8216;related&#8217;/&#8217;promoted&#8217;) clips: you now see 13 of them on the frist page instead of 5.
