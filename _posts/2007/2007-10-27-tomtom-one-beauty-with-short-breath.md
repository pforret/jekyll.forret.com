[<img  width="188" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/101/306909170_9c5ce48c94_m.jpg" alt="TomTom voice: Norma" height="240" style="float: right" />](http://www.flickr.com/photos/pforret/306909170/ "Photo Sharing") The [TomTom One](http://www.tomtom.com/products/product.php?ID=233&Category=14&Lid=5) (the &#8216;old&#8217; model) is my first ever GPS. Overall, an excellent design. I never had to open the manual because it is a very intuitive device. The route calculation is quite fast and accurate, and with the Spanish &#8220;Norma&#8221; voice installed, it is even a pleasure to be told where to go (&#8220;_despues de ocho cientos metros, gire a la derecha_&#8220;).

The only problem with the device is that within 6 months of buying it, the battery started running out very quickly. Actually, it is not always short of breath, but mostly. Sometimes when I turn off the ignition (which stops power to the GPS) it will die within seconds. Other times, it might keep on running for an hour. Feels like a bad contact inside but the standard engineering trick for this (&#8220;hit device hard with right hand&#8221;) doesn&#8217;t help.

According to TomTom support (but I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s why my battery gave up):

> Speaking of the battery, TomTom told me by phone today that I should navigate using the battery and not the in-car charger. The customer rep said that overcharging was an issue if I left it connected continually.

When I check the boot screen (reset and keep pressing the power button while turning on, [via](http://www.jouwnav.nl/forum/lofiversion/index.php/t5561.html)) then my battery gives 4140 mV, which is a good enough score. So I don&#8217;t think buying a new battery would help (they sell for less than 20€ at e.g. [www.mdsbatterie.com.fr](http://www.mdsbatterie.com.fr/departments/department002.asp?Brand=TomTom&DepartmentName=PDA+%2F+GPS&DepartmentID=176)). I guess I&#8217;ll just wait a bit and go for the TomTom One XL. Size matters.
