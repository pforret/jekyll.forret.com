I was recently introduced to the fact that, in some cultures, the days of the week have associated colors, and that one might take these into account when choosing what to wear, to eat or drink. I looked into it and found the explanation. These are the weekday colors, as defined by the [Ayurveda](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayurveda), the ancient healing science that is native to the Indian subcontinent.
