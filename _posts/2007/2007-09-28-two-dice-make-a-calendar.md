Little riddle: if you have two dice (so each has 6 sides), with 1 digit on each side and you want to be able to form all numbers between 1 and 31 (for the days of the month), what digits would be on each dice? E.g. if dice #1 has 0-1-2-3-4-5 and the second 4-5-6-7-8-9, it won&#8217;t work, because you cannot form the number &#8217;22&#8217;.

Try to guess and I&#8217;ll give the answer next week. There&#8217;s a little trick involved! I first tried to figure it out without looking at the dice, and I enjoyed the mind gymnastics.
