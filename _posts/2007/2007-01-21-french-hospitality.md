**French hospitality #1**

I&#8217;ve just spent a great weekend with the family in France. A couple from Antwerp has restored a &#8220;gentilhommi√®re&#8221; (small castle) in [Le Thurel](http://www.lethurel.com/) (Picardie) as a gite d&#8217;etappe and turned it into a pleasant bed-and-breakfast!

Long walks on the beach, excellent food and abundance of wine. Splendid!

**French hospitality #2**  
Returning home was less pleasant however. After less than a km, we were stopped by two gendarmes on bikes for a presumed ignoring of a &#8220;stop&#8221; sign. They gleefully treated as a bunch of &#8220;petits Belges&#8221; (&#8220;_I don&#8217;t know how it works in Belgium, but in this country we have to obey the law_&#8220;). They escorted us to the cash machine so that we could take out 90 euros. They might call it &#8216;upholding the law&#8217; but it sure feels like a highway robbery.  
I didn&#8217;t even argue. When you put an asshole in a uniform, he becomes an asshole that always right, as I&#8217;ve learned contesting a fine for _honking my horn_ five years ago (funny detail: it wasn&#8217;t me who honked, but good luck trying to prove that).
