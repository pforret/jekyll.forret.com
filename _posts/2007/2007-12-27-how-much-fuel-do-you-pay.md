My friend Henry asked me to calculate on a napkin how much I spent on fuel per month. I have a greedy car, but I live close to the office. Still I was quite surprised by the number I got.

Let's take some examples:

  * You drive a modest [Citroen C3 1.4 HDI](https://toolstud.io/finance/mileage.php?currency=%E2%82%AC&fuelprice=1.2&fuelprice_unit=1&carmileage=4.4&carmileage_unit=l%2F100km&distance=8000&distance_unit=1&lifetime=5&lifetime_unit=1) (4.4l/100km). You travel 20 km to and from work every day (8000km/year).  
    You pay 5.28€/100km or about 35.2 €/month.&nbsp;
  * You drive an [Audi A4 break TDI](https://toolstud.io/finance/mileage.php?currency=%E2%82%AC&fuelprice=1.2&fuelprice_unit=1&carmileage=5.6&carmileage_unit=l%2F100km&distance=32000&distance_unit=1&lifetime=5&lifetime_unit=1) (5.6 l/100km). You travel 80 km to and from work every day (32000 km/year).  
    You pay 6.72 €/100km, or about 179.2 €/month.
  * You drive a [BMW 750i](https://toolstud.io/finance/mileage.php?currency=%E2%82%AC&fuelprice=1.2&fuelprice_unit=1&carmileage=11.4&carmileage_unit=l%2F100km&distance=20000&distance_unit=1&lifetime=5&lifetime_unit=1) (11.4 l/100km). You travel 50km to and from work every day (20000km/year).  
    You pay 13.68 €/100km, or about 228 €/month.
  * Big spender: you drive a [Range Rover Sport](http://web.forret.com/tools/car_cost.asp?l100km=15.9&price=super95&liter=88&km=1000&km_unit=km_7&title=RangeRover+Sport) (15.90 l/100km). You travel 100km back and forth.  
    You pay 19.08 €/100km, or 636 €/month.

OK, if you buy a RangeRover Sport, you're not really looking at the price, but still.

How much do you spend?
