I got an email from [Gene Graham](http://www.genegrahamonline.com/), who has just finished his first full-length documentary on the early days of Disco. Me being a fan of house and disco music, that is one movie I&#8217;d like to see!

> [The Godfather of Disco](http://www.thegodfatherofdiscodoc.com/) is a feature-length documentary based on Mel Cheren&#8217;s powerful autobiography: _My Life and the Paradise Garage: Keep On Dancin&#8217;_. Through a series of interviews with a who’s who of the dance music community, The Godfather of Disco follows the arc of Mel’s life to examine the early 70s musical and cultural currents that gave birth to disco; [West End Records](http://www.westendrecords.com/)&#8216; contribution to that scene; and the rise of the [Paradise Garage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradise_Garage).  
> (&#8230;)  
> This documentary not only celebrates the foundation of the dance music scene, it contains interviews with some of todays biggest industry players like Louis Vega, Kevin Hedge, Tony Humphries, Louis Benedetti, Barbara Tucker, and Deli G to name a few.

Gene has already won the Emerging Filmmaker Award at the 2007 Minneapolis/St.Paul Internationla Film Festival. I wish him all the best for the other festivals where the movie will be shown, and I hope I get to see it eventually!
