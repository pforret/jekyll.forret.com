This is the 3rd edition of this &#8216;unconference&#8217; that has proven to be a great place to meet new people and ideas.

### Attendees = participants

So what is this _&#8216;unconferencing&#8217;_ thing about?

> A BarCamp is an ad-hoc gathering born from the desire for people to share and learn in an open environment. It is an intense event with discussions, demos, and interaction from participants. ([barcamp.org](http://barcamp.org/))

<!--more-->

  
The rules:

> Attendees must give a demo, a session, or help with one, or otherwise volunteer / contribute in some way to support the event. All presentations are scheduled the day they happen. Prepare in advance, but come early to get a slot on the wall. The people present at the event will select the demos or presentations they want to see. Presenters are responsible for making sure that notes/slides/audio/video of their presentations are published on the web for the benefit of all and those who canâ€™t be present.

So even if you do not do a presentation, you can still help out. What I am already looking for at this moment is:

  * 1 person to organize the recording of all sessions: he/she will have to make sure there are enough cameras, that there is someone at each presentation to videotape it, and will also make sure all recordings are published on a videohosting site like Youtube.
  * 3-5 persons who will do the actual recording, with their own camera or one that we could borrow. Since there will be three simultaneous tracks, 3 is the minimum, but for security, five would be better.
  * 2 extra projectors (we already have 1)

### The topics

What can you talk about?  
Well, it the broad sense: Internet, technology and its impact on our lives. That can include topics like: blogging([*](http://barcamp.forret.com/blog/2006/10/02/flemish-blog-services/)), SEO ([*](http://barcamp.forret.com/blog/2006/09/26/googles-dirty-little-secret/)), marketing ([*](http://barcamp.forret.com/blog/2006/09/25/what-marketeers-could-learn/)), Photoshop ([*](http://barcamp.forret.com/blog/2006/06/01/pieter-jelle-de-brue-photoshop-web-design-passage-17h/)), hosting ([*](http://barcamp.forret.com/blog/2006/06/01/frank-lauwers-hosting-web-20-passage-15h/)), mobile ([*](http://barcamp.forret.com/blog/2006/06/01/tanguy-dekelver-nokia-lifeblog-maelbeek-10h30/)), virtual reality ([*](http://barcamp.forret.com/blog/2006/06/01/workspaces-unlimited-polak-16h30/)), webdesign ([*](http://barcamp.forret.com/blog/2006/05/29/frederic-devries-building-for-the-blind-passage-14h/)) &#8230; It does not have to be Internet based: e.g. I am planning a presentation on musical mashups.
