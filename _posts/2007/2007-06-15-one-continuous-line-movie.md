This is the video to &#8220;In Context&#8221; by [Field Music](http://www.myspace.com/fieldmusic). It&#8217;s just a hand drawing a really long line on a white background, but it&#8217;s worth watching until the end.

> This is one of those videos you just have to keep watching to the end. The hand drawing the image belongs to a photographer called Chris Fenner who has been a friend of director [Dan Lowe](http://www.partizan.com/partizan/musicvideos/?dan_lowe) ever since they met at university. Dan designed the image we see at the end using pictures found on the internet and ideas he got from the band. Then after rehearsing and rehearsing all day, Chris drew the image, and would have got it all in one take if the pen hadnâ€™t run out. Drawing the picture took 27 minutes and by the end of the shoot Chris could barely move his hand for cramp.
