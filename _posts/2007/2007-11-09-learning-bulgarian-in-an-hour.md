Just read an interesting post: [How to Learn (But Not Master) Any Language in 1 Hour](http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/2007/11/07/how-to-learn-but-not-master-any-language-in-1-hour-plus-a-favor/). Let's see how that works out with [Bulgarian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulgarian_language).

#### Introduction

Bulgarian is a slavic language written in a cyrillic alphabet of 30 letters:

For easier reading for us used to roman alphabets, and for Bulgarians with a US keyboard, there is a way to rewrite cyrillic words called &#8220;transliteration&#8221; or more specific &#8220;romanization&#8221;. I have -obviously- created one: [Bulgarian romanization: cyrillic <> latin](http://tools.forret.com/romanize/bulgarian.php).

#### Difficulty

First estimating the difficulty of learning this language:

  1. _Are there new grammatical structures that will postpone fluency? (look at SOV vs. SVO, as well as noun cases)_  
    Bulgarian seems to be a SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) language, just like Dutch & English.
  2. _Are there new sounds that will double or quadruple time to fluency? (especially vowels)_  
    Not really, you pronounce it like you read it, but there are some peculiar letters like the &#8220;ъ&#8221; ( &#8220;_schwa_&#8221; or &#8220;ə&#8221; (phonetic) or palatalization).
  3. _How similar is it to languages I already understand? What will help and what will interfere? (Will acquisition erase a previous language? Can I borrow structures without fatal interference like Portuguese after Spanish?)_  
    While Bulgarian adopts new words from English easily (e.g. businessman become &#8220;бизнесмен&#8221; which is transcribed as &#8220;_biznеsmеn_&#8220;), it is at the base a Slavic language with an abundance of words that have nothing to do with the words in Dutch/French/English.  
    Let's take the days of the week: понеделник вторник сряда четвъртък петък съботата неделята &#8211; which is transcribed into &#8220;_pоnеdеlnik vtоrnik sryada chеtvartak pеtak sabоtata nеdеlyata_&#8220;. Not that obvious, is it?
  4. _All of which answer: How difficult will it be, and how long would it take to become functionally fluent?_  
    God, if I knew the answer to that question.

#### <!--more-->Language structure

Let's take his 8 sentences that clarify a lot about how the language works:

> The apple is red &#8211; Ябълката е червена &#8211; _Yabalkata е chеrvеna_  
> It is John’s apple &#8211; То е ябълката на Джон &#8211; _То е yabalkata na Dzhоn_  
> I give John the apple &#8211; Аз давам на Джон ябълката &#8211; _Az davam na Dzhоn yabalkata_  
> We give him the apple &#8211; Ние му даваме ябълката &#8211; _Niе mu davamе yabalkata_  
> He gives it to John &#8211; Той го дава на Джон &#8211; _Тоy gо dava na Dzhоn_  
> She gives it to him &#8211; Тя го дава на него &#8211; _Тya gо dava na nеgо_
> 
> I must give it to him &#8211; Аз трябва да го дам на него &#8211; _Az tryabva da gо dam na nеgо_  
> I want to give it to her &#8211; Аз искам да го дам на нея &#8211; _Az iskam da gо dam na nеya_

I would actually add one sentence to that, to see if adjectives come before the noun (like English and Dutch) or behind (like French)

> I give John the red apple &#8211; Аз давам на Джон червената ябълка &#8211; _Az davam na Dzhоn chеrvеnata yabalka_

Before the noun it is!

#### Helping verbs

And the verbs for easy auxiliary usage are:

  * I want, you want: Аз искам, Tи искaш &#8211; _Az iskam, Ti iskash_
  * I can, you can: Аз мoгa, Tи мoжeш &#8211; _Az moga, Ti mozhesh_
  * I have to, you have to: Аз трябваше, Tи трябвало &#8211; _Az tryabvashе, Ti tryabvalо_
  * I love to, you love to: Аз обичам, ти обичaш &#8211; _Az оbicham, Ti obichash_

#### Sounds and scripts

Bulgarian has 6 vowels: A E И O У Ъ, and two that are a combination of a consonant and a vowel: Ю (yu) &#8211; Я (ya). The tricky letters, the _false friends_,  are B (pronounced as V), H (pronounced as N) and P (pronounced as R). The C is pronounced as S but that's also the case in &#8220;poli**c**e&#8221;.
