Imagine one would have a certain amount of money on one&#8217;s [Paypal](http://www.paypal.com) account, and one would like to spend that on hardware or other physical goods. Let&#8217;s now limit that to shops active in Belgium, Netherlands and Luxemburg. What are your options? Well, not a lot, it appears.

**Computer/photography/electronics**  
My favourite is Pixmania: they have a big collection of all kinds of devices and good prices.

[shop.cdfreaks.com](http://shop.cdfreaks.com/index/2/1) sells blank DVD/CD and printer ink and also accepts Paypal.  
Apart from that? [Foto Konijnenberg](http://www.fotokonijnenberg.nl): no. [Thomann](http://www.thomann.de): no.

**Books/CD/DVD**  
[Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=513058): no. [Proxis](http://www.proxis.be/help/EN/payment.htm): no. [Azur](http://www.azur.be/index.php?page=CONTENT&cname=tranporta#1): no. [Bol.com](http://www.nl.bol.com/is-bin/INTERSHOP.enfinity/eCS/Store/nl/-/EUR/BOL_ViewStatic-Start;sid=XoCHp-0Tf32H5aimtOG5kA3LS33wCEchfLk=?Section=none&Template=help%2fBOL_help_overview&subcat=89BC1B950A0A030A005F5681B661168D#8F2A89590A0A030A00CEB042963CB7EE): no.

Personally, I find this list quite short. Even if we would extend our choice to any shop that does not charge high shipping costs to Belgium, what are the options? The sold product should not be too obscure (no &#8220;shop with books on the noble art of patchwork&#8221;). Do you know any?
