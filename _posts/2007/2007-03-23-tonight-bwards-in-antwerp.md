It&#8217;s gonna take me some effort to arrive there in time, but tonight is the [Bwards event](http://bwards.carreconfiture.be/) in Antwerp, and I&#8217;m looking forward to it! It looks like [Jeroen](http://www.carreconfiture.be) has created a fun party for those of us with a URL and an opinion. The place to be is [Het Paleis](http://www.hetpaleis.be/), and here is how to get there: [clopin.be](http://www.clopin.be/archives/2007/03/21/bwards-er-geraken/).
