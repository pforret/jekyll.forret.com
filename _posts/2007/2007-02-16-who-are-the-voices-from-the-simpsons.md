Did you know that the voices from Homer Simpson, Grampa Abraham Simpson, Barney Gumble, Krusty the Clown, Groundskeeper Willie, Mayor Quimby, Sideshow Mel, Itchy and still half a dozen others are all done by the same man? 

Check out the following interview with six of the main voice actors from The Simpsons: [Dan Castellaneta](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0144657/) (the voice behind all the characters cited above), [Julie Kavner](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001413/) (Marge Simpson and Patty/Selma), [Yeardley Smith](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0810379/) (Lisa Simpson, but also played in As Good As It Gets), [Nancy Cartwright](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004813/) (Bart Simpson &#8211; is actually a woman!!), [Hank Azaria](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000279/) (Moe Szyslak, Chief Wiggum/Carl Carlson, Apu Nahasapeemapetilon &#8230;, but also known as an actor in Mad about you, Along came Polly and Quiz Show) and [Harry Shearer](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0790434/) (Mr Burns/Mr Smithers/Ned Flanders/Kent Brockman/Rev.
