I don&#8217;t know if I was expecting too much, but the content of the Humo&#8217;s Pop Poll De Luxe was a bit of a disappointment. Thanks to my [good connections](http://www.bnox.be) I was the &#8220;+1&#8221; for a VIP-ticket yesterday at the Sportpaleis. While the VIP-treatment is always a most enjoyable circumstance, during the show we often had a &#8220;WTF?&#8221; feeling, but not in a good sense. K3 doing &#8220;3 biggetjes&#8221; comes to mind, and the dance steps of the woman that was supposed to be the head of TV station één (she wasn&#8217;t). DJ Tony from Willy&#8217;s en Marjetten (Bart Depauw) came on stage in a Borat minimal swimming outfit and placed an image in our mind that took several doses of alcohol to get rid of afterwards. Whoever wrote Roos&#8217; texts wasn&#8217;t very inspired and even the Methusalem of Humo(r), Guy Mortier, who undoubtedly writes his own texts, was not up to his &#8211; granted, quite high- level. Most of the comedy acts went for cheap routines on gays, blacks and women. Wim Helsen even combined all three in an interview with Tom Lanoye. The best stand-up comedy act came from a Dutch guy: [Najib Amhali](http://www.najibamhali.nl/). Ouch!

As for the music: most of it was loud. It felt more like a circus: everyone was invited to do one or two tricks and then disappear again. Why a group like the Van Jets were invited to play, will remain a mystery for me. The musical highlights for me:

Just after the break: [Steven Wold](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seasick_Steve) aka &#8220;[Seasick Steve](http://www.seasicksteve.com/)&#8221; who played blues with just a guitar and a heavy left foot. Authentic, addictive and big fun.

Geike Arnaert together with Sioen did a cover of Nick Cave&#8217;s &#8220;Wild Rose&#8221;. Gripping and classy. &#8216;Kiekevel&#8217;!

Then this morning I went to [the HUMO site](http://www.humo.be) to see what pictures they published from yesterday. They must have at least one good photographer close to the stage, and that person must now be pissed off: they published the photos in a 335*223 format (i.e tiny) and so excessively sharpened (at least that&#8217;s what I think they&#8217;ve done) that faces become deformed and artefacts abundant. Take a look at the [following picture](http://www.humo.be/fotospecial/poppoll%202007%20optredens/slides/geike%20en%20sioen.html):

Sioen has a square blob for a nose and Geike looks as if her make-up had been taken care of by a myopic monkey with Parkinson&#8217;s disease. My pictures, taken from 100m distance with a low-quality 55mm lens can be found on Flickr: [Humo&#8217;s Pop Poll 2007](http://www.flickr.com/photos/pforret/sets/72157600011049138/)
