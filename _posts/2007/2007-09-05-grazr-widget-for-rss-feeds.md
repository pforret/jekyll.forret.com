I am always on the lookout for original ways to use RSS feeds, and the [Grazr widget service](http://grazr.com/config.html) is quite neat for text-based feeds. It consists of a Flash-based reader with a neat interface. Here an example for [OverheardInNewYork](http://www.overheardinnewyork.com/):

<p style="width: 100%; height: 300px">
  <a target="gz" href="http://grazr.com/gzpanel.html?theme=milk_white&view=s&font=Georgia&fontsize=9pt&file=http://www.overheardinnewyork.com/index.xml"><img border="0" src="http://grazr.com/images/grazrbadge.png" /></a>
</p>

And they pointed me to [SimplePie](http://simplepie.org/), a simple replacement for MagPieRSS, the PHP-based RSS library I always used. Another thing to check out!
