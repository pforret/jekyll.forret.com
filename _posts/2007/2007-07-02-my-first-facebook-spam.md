The Belgian Facebook community is growing and I was expecting to have a first &#8216;spam&#8217; invitation eventually. It came a couple of days ago, from a group that goes by the name &#8220;In Loving Memory of Juliane Angel&#8221;. It seems to be created by a guy in rememberance of a girl that died some time ago (Juliane Angel). Even if this sad story is not a marketing ploy (which I don&#8217;t think it is), the invitations are still &#8216;unsollicited&#8217;. Whether they are &#8216;commercial&#8217; is hard to say now, that might only become apparent when there are enough members (only two for the moment).

When [I joined Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=500851757), there were only a few people on it that I knew. The last couple of weeks, there have been invitations coming in on a daily basis of people that I (sort-of) know. The typical early adaptors, of course, but also some outsiders. Juliane is the first spam attempt I get &#8211; not a full-fledged Nigerian scam or erection drug, I admit, but still. I hope Facebook can control misuse; because MySpace surely can&#8217;t.
