This week in my newspaper: there&#8217;s a re-issue of the fabulous &#8220;Steve McQueen&#8221; album (1985) by [Prefab Sprout](http://www.prefabsprout.net/). Prefab Sprout is: songwriter Paddy McAloon on vocals, guitars, keyboards, Martin McAloon on bass, Wendy Smith on backing vocals, guitars, Neil Conti on drums. It was one of the first vinyl records I ever bought and certainly one of the best. The quality of the album might have something to do with the producer: [Thomas Dolby](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Dolby). 

Big surprise: instead of having to look for the lyrics on some shady spyware-infested illegal site, you can find them right there on the Prefab Sprout site:

> My love and I, we are boxing clever  
> She&#8217;ll never crowd me out  
> Fall be free as old confetti  
> And paint the town, paint the town  
> ([When Love Breaks Down](http://www.prefabsprout.net/lyrics/whenlovebreaksdown.html))

What does it mean? I have no idea. 

For those of you for who the group name does not ring a bell, here&#8217;s some videos, taking you back, all the way to the eighties!
