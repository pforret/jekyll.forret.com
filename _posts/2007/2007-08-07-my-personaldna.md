If you want to hear a lot of compliments about yourself that sound more-or-less correct, take the [PersonalDNA](http://www.personaldna.com/tests.php) test.

>   * You&#8217;re in touch with what is going on around you and adept at remaining down-to-earth and logical.
>   * Although you&#8217;re detail-oriented, this doesn&#8217;t mean that you lose the big picture.
>   * You tend to find beauty in form and efficiency, as opposed to finding it in broad-based, abstract concepts.
>   * Never one to pass on an adventure, you&#8217;re consistently seeking and finding new things, even in your immediate surroundings.
>   * Because of this eagerness to pursue new experiences, you&#8217;ve learned a lot; your attention to detail means that you gain a great deal from your adventures.
>   * The intellectual curiosity that drives you leads you to seek out causes of and reasons behind things.
>   * &#8230;
>   * You don&#8217;t mind being in social situations, as you feel comfortable enough with people to be yourself.
>   * Your caring nature goes beyond a basic concern: you take the time to understand the nuances of people&#8217;s situations before passing any sort of judgment.
>   * You&#8217;re a good listener, and even better at offering advice.
>   * You&#8217;re concerned with others at both an individual and societal levelâ€”you sympathize with the plights of troubled groups, and you can care about people you&#8217;ve never met.
