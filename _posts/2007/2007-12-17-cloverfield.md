[Cloverfield](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1060277/) (released in Feb 2008)

> &#8220;Five young New Yorkers throw their friend a going-away party the night that a monster the size of a skyscraper descends upon the city. Told from the point of view of their video camera, the film is a document of their attempt to survive the most surreal, horrifying event of their lives.&#8221;  
> from [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloverfield)

Produced by J.J. Abrams (from Lost/Alias).

At least this time, they&#8217;re telling the story in less than 3 hours, instead of four or more consecutive seasons.
