I just discovered a really neat online publication: [Cabinet Magazine](http://cabinetmagazine.org). Here follows one of their articles, on Andrew Mole, a American photographer of the early 20th century. Kind of a [Spencer Tunick](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spencer_Tunick), with a patriotic message and way more clothes (uniforms, actually).  
![Living Portrait of President Woodrow Wilson](http://cabinetmagazine.org/issues/24/assets/images/kaplan3.jpg) 

> Living Portrait of President Woodrow Wilson, for which 21,000 troops assembled at Camp Sherman in Chillicothe, Ohio, in 1918, is the best-known of Mole’s photographs. The image is characteristic of Mole’s work in that it wavers between the compositional effect of the whole (i.e. a portrait of Woodrow Wilson) and the desire to focus upon the obscured individuals who constitute the image, thereby undermining the optical illusion of the totality to a degree. To call this image a portrait would be misleading because the subject of the representation is not so much the countenance of Woodrow Wilson as what he represents and symbolizes.
