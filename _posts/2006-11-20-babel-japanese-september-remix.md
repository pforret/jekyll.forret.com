&#8220;[Babel](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0449467/)&#8221; links up three stories on three continents in a clever way. Mexican director Iñárritu has probably made one of the best movies of 2006. I&#8217;m not gonna tell anything more about the plot (but girls: it features Brad Pitt and Gael García Bernal). Just go and see it!

One very pleasant discovery halfway was the excellent Japanese remix of &#8220;September&#8221; ([Earth Wind and Fire](http://www.earthwindandfire.com/)). It starts off all sampled and cut up, but I recognized it quite fast (I have a thing for [sampling](http://www.xampled.com/)). So who was responsible for this funky rework of an already fabulous original?

I did some Googling when I got home and I found the following reference: _&#8220;September&#8221; &#8211; Shinichi Osawa_ (via [cduniverse.com](http://www.cduniverse.com/search/xx/music/pid/7305331/a/Babel.htm)). I found no other reference but Shinichi also appears on a [Earth, Wind & Fire Remixes](http://www.discogs.com/release/617952) album by [Soul Source](http://www.universal-music.co.jp/soul_source/) (aka Ken Yanai). On that album, however, Shinichi remixes &#8220;Brazilian Rhyme&#8221; and September is remixed by [Fantastic Plastic Machine](http://www.fpmnet.com/) aka Tanaka Tomoyuki. Shinichi is also the DJ behind [Mondo Grosso](http://www.mondogrosso.com/), and I actually own &#8220;Vibe PM&#8221; on Dimitri From Paris&#8217; [Monsieur Dimitri&#8217;s De-Luxe House Of Funk](http://www.discogs.com/release/18340), remixed by Masters at Work. All this namedropping just to state that there is a whole Japanese house-scene that I was not aware off. Great discovery times ahead!

_UPDATE: apparently it&#8217;s a mashup of Fatboy Slim&#8217;s &#8220;[The Joker](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xgk9ouBuj-4)&#8221; (remixed by [ATFC](http://www.htfr.com/more-info/MR149598)) and Earth Wind & Fire &#8220;September&#8221; (remixed by Fantastic Plastic Machine), and the mashup was created by Shinichi Osawa. All the samples I found online only let you hear the &#8220;September&#8221; part, so you can&#8217;t hear the cut &#8216;n paste work Shinishi has done._
