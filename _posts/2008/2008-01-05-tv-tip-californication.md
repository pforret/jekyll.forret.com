Since I have a lot of time on my hands, with my pneumonia and all, I started looking at TV series I hadn&#8217;t seen yet. I borrowed the Sopranos DVDs, but I also tried out some &#8216;alternative distribution&#8217; series. [Supernatural](http://www.tv.com/supernatural/show/30144/summary.html) is not really my thing, [Jericho](http://www.tv.com/jericho-2006/show/58068/summary.html) is OK, [Weeds](http://www.tv.com/weeds/show/28829/summary.html) seems not bad at all, but my current favourite is definitely &#8220;[Californication](http://www.tv.com/californication/show/68749/summary.html)&#8220;.

> David Duchovny heads up the cast in this comedy about a novelist with sex and drug addictions who is struggling to raise his daughter half the time, while having problems with his ex-girlfriend.

<!--more-->Duchovny jumps from one bed to the next, not bothered by any set of morals. Meanwhile he delivers some kick-ass one-liners. The ex is played by Natascha McElhone, who looks a lot like a girl I was once in love with, so that adds to the attraction. If you know how to get these things onto your hard disk: try out the first episodes and see if you like them!
