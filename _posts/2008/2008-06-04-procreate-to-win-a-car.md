I'm getting old, I guess. [This ad campaign](http://www.babymadeonboard.be/) annoys me. For those who don&#8217;t understand Dutch: if you take a Dodge Journey for a test-drive on the Father&#8217;s Day weekend, and make a baby on the back seat, then you have a chance of winning a car.

First off: it&#8217;s borderline immoral. There can be several reasons to have children, but winning a car shouldn&#8217;t be a motivation. Having children is quite a big thing. To make it into a gamble with a prize, feels wrong.

Secondly: the logistics. I can imagine they won&#8217;t require the couples to stay in the showroom with the car to perform the act, but where do you park? Side of the road? Public parking? In the garage at home? You&#8217;d need to live close enough to a garage. And what about the activities that happened in the car before you entered? _What&#8217;s that smell? Is that a &#8230; on the backseat? OMG! Never mind, baby, we only have an hour, hurry! Close your eyes and think of off-road adventures._

And then the criterium for winning: the baby that&#8217;s closest to 8 March 2009 wins. I can imagine some future parents instructing their gynaecologist to have the birth on exactly that date. There&#8217;s a possibility for a 20K euro car, so if the baby has to come prematurely, then that&#8217;s just how it&#8217;s gotta be. And if you have 3 babies born on 8 March, that&#8217;s all equally &#8216;close&#8217;, right? Who will be chosen? The one that was born the closest to 12AM? (&#8220;_Nurse, can, you change that hour of birth? Like one hour later, say 11.53AM?_&#8220;)

For me this is a campaign thought out on the back of a napkin after a bit too much of alcohol. It should have stayed on that napkin.
