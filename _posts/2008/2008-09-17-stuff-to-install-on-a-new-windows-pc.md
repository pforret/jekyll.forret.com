That is, the stuff I install on a new Windows PC. Since I need this list several times a year, why not make a blog post of it. As you will see,I have a more than average interest in video (conversion) and sysadmin (SSH/FTP). The links typically go straight to the download page.

**Audio/video**

  * [iTunes](http://www.apple.com/itunes/download/) (+Quicktime): excellent music manager and it rips to MP3 really fast
  * [CDBurnerXP](http://www.cdburnerxp.se/): for burning CDs, DVDs, ISO files
  * [Irfanview](http://www.irfanview.com/main_download_engl.htm): image viewer, editor and converter &#8211; for people who think Photoshop is overkill
  * [Picasa](http://picasa.google.com/): photograph workflow & archive manager (from Google)
  * [VLC Player](http://www.videolan.org/vlc/download-windows.html): ultimate video player, very complete set of codecs
  * [ffmpeg](http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=205275&package_id=248632)Â with a GUI like [GVC](http://teejee2008.wordpress.com/category/my-freewares/gvc-my-freewares/): video conversion: AVI, MOV, MPG, MP4, &#8230;
  * [Handbrake](http://handbrake.fr/?article=download): will make a good MPEG4 of any DVD in one go

**Internet**

  * [Skype](http://www.skype.com/intl/en/download/): for chat, phonecalls and SMSes with people far away
  * [Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome), [Firefox](http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/all.html) or [Opera](http://www.opera.com/download/) browser &#8211; personally I like Firefox less. Opera is solid and fast, Google Chrome is an interesting new kid on the block.
  * [FileZilla](http://filezilla-project.org/download.php?type=client): FTP client
  * [Putty](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html): SSH and telnet terminal
  * [EditPlus](http://www.editplus.com/download.html): customisable editor for text, HTML, CMD &#8230; that also works over FTP
  * [uTorrent](http://www.utorrent.com/): because sometimes you need to &#8230; get stuff, you know

**Tools**

  * [Google Pack](http://pack.google.com/): contains Picasa, Skype, Google Toolbar and a whole bunch of other useful programs
  * [Adobe PDF](http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readstep2.html) reader: for reading PDF documents, and everything is in PDF these days
  * [7-Zip](http://www.7-zip.org/download.html): compression/expansion of ZIP, RAR and 7z archives
  * [CutePDF](http://www.cutepdf.com/Products/CutePDF/writer.asp) with GhostScript: printing to a PDF file (also allows converting a PostScript PS/EPS file to PDF)
  * [UnixUtils](http://unxutils.sourceforge.net/): I&#8217;m a sucker for GAWK and WGET
  * [Nokia PCSuite](http://www.nokia.co.uk/A4630249): for synchro with my Nokia N91 (yes, it&#8217;s still my phone!)
  * [XAMPP](http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp-windows.html): for developing with Apache/PERL/PHP/MySQL on Windows
