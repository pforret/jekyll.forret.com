My current favourite lens for my Canon 350D is the [Canon EF 50mm F 1.8 II ø 52 mm](http://www.fotokonijnenberg.nl/product_details.php?id_product=650). I really like the wide aperture (f/1.8) that allows me to take pictures without flash in dark environments like tango events, and the small depth-of-field that brings out the subject really nice. Plus, it was only 100€ when I bought it, and now it&#8217;s even at 84€.

But a 50mm lens in a small digital SLR is equivalent to a 75mm, and sometimes that&#8217;s too much. I have to step 2m backwards to get a portrait of two persons (people ask this, you know), and even further if I want a picture of a tango couple with their feet included as well as their head. So I&#8217;d like to find a second lens with at least the same aperture, and with a lower focal distance, at a non-ridiculous price (below 400€).

Candidates seem to be:

  * [Canon EF 28mm F 1.8 USM 58mm](http://www.fotokonijnenberg.nl/product_details.php?id_product=12245) &#8211; 411€
  * [Sigma 28mm F 1.8 EX DG Asf Macro Canon](http://www.fotokonijnenberg.nl/product_details.php?id_product=8795) &#8211; 295€
  * [Sigma 24mm F 1.8 EX DG ASF Macro Can AF](http://www.fotokonijnenberg.nl/product_details.php?id_product=8775) &#8211; 385€
  * [Sigma 30mm f/1.4 EX DC (HSM) DG Canon](http://www.fotokonijnenberg.nl/product_details.php?id_product=11522) &#8211; 399€
  * Tamron starts at 750€, so yeah &#8230;

Does anyone have experience with these lenses? Any suggestions?
