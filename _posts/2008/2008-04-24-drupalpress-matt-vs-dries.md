On my left side: [Matt Mullenweg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Mullenweg):

  * Matt was born in 1984 in Houston, Texas.
  * Amongst other things (see below) Matt is a [passionate photographer](http://ma.tt/photos/log/).
  * In Jan 2003, unhappy with the capabilities of B2/Cafelog, he starts with the development of what will grow to be the hottest blog platform software around: [WordPress](http://www.wordpress.org).
  * In October 2004 he moves from Houston to San Francisco to work for CNET on, amongst other things, WordPress.
  * In October 2005, he leaves CNET too concentrate on WordPress and also launches [Akismet](http://akismet.com/), a (comment/trackback) _spam detection platform_ (with plugins for e.g. WordPress).
  * In November 2005 Matt launches [WordPress.com](http://wordpress.com), the (free) hosted WordPress provider.
  * In Dec 2005 Matt annouces the creation of [AutoMattic](http://automattic.com/), the company behind WordPress.com, Akismet.
  * Matt is cited as [#16](http://www.pcworld.com/article/id,129301-page,5-c,techindustrytrends/article.html) on PCWorld's list of &#8220;50 Most Important People on the Web&#8221;

At my right hand: [Dries Buytaert](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dries_Buytaert):

  * Dries is born in 1978, in Belgium.
  * Amongst other things (see below), Dries is a [passionate photographer](http://buytaert.net/photos).
  * Grown out of a small-scale bulletin board experiment, Drupal is released as open-source CMS in Jan 2001. Dries is and will remain lead developer and ultimate-veto-editor-in-chief.
  * In Nov 2007 Dries starts [Acquia](http://acquia.com/), &#8220;[a company that is to Drupal what Ubuntu or RedHat are to Linux](http://acquia.com/blog/drupal-startup)&#8220;
  * Dries becomes Dr. Buytaert in Jan 2008
  * Acquia launches its [Mollom](http://mollom.com/) service, a _spam detection platform_ (with plugins for e.g. Drupal)
  * In April 2008 Dries is cited as one of BusinessWeek's [Young Entrepreneurs of Tech](http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/apr2008/tc20080417_388737.htm)

I especially like the &#8216;spam detection' detail. If this is the main concern of two of the leading CMS platforms, you can imagine spam is a real problem.

If we extrapolate on the previous similarities, we could expect:

  * something like Drupal.com &#8211; a _freemium_ hosted Drupal provider. The free version gives you an instant xyz.drupal.com site with some standard themes (layouts) and plugins. If you want your own domain, or a custom layout, you will have to pay.
  * a Mollom plugin for WordPress &#8211; because there is already an [Akismet plugin for Drupal](http://drupal.org/project/akismet)
  * WordPress starts releasing &#8216;distributions': a special version for e.g. NGO's, for schools, for music groups. This distribution will contain the latest core of WordPress with some plugins, themes, widgets, pages &#8230; pre-installed.

In any case, I admire both guys and hope they continue to successfully lead some of the most promising web software platforms around.
