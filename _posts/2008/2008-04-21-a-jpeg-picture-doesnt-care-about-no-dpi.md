Every now and then I get a request to use pictures of mine for a poster, a flyer, a book. People usually find the pictures they want in my [Flickr sets](http://www.flickr.com/photos/pforret/sets/), where they are available in a max resolution of 1200 pixels for the longest side (so e.g. 1200 x 800 for photos in 3:2 aspect ratio). When this is not enough, people ask me for higher resolution versions. And that question comes in two versions:

  * the **logical** i&#8217;m-used-to-this-digital-stuff version: &#8220;_could I get those pictures in 1800&#215;1200_&#8221; / &#8220;_Can I have at least 2 megapixels_&#8220;?
  * the **weird** I-used-to-work-in print version: &#8220;_can you send them in 300dpi_&#8220;?

DPI (dots-per-inch) only make sense for me if I would know on what size you want to print them. If you&#8217;re making an [A4](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_size#ANSI_paper_sizes) flyer, that&#8217;s 8½ × 11 inch, and you need 300 dpi, then that means you need 3300&#215;2550 pixels. If you want to print only an A6 size, that&#8217;s 1650&#215;1275 pixels. So don&#8217;t tell me what DPI you need, tell me what pixel dimensions you need. Yes, you can save the DPI parameter in a JPEG file, but it changes nothing to the data. My 1200&#215;800 picture with a DPI value of 72 or 300dpi is still, pixel by pixel, the same picture. Your image viewer might decide to show it as a bigger picture on the screen, but the image data is **identical.**

> Beginning to see the pattern? No matter what DPI you set (or, as it happens, what size in inches) so long as you don&#8217;t let Photoshop resample the image up or down, it&#8217;s STILL 504 by 144 pixels.

> Sorry. All three files are exactly the same size.

So, if you&#8217;re asking someone for a high-resolution version of a digital picture, ask for **minimum pixel dimensions**, _not for DPI_! Otherwise you just show that, while you might have experience in managing print, you have no clue how digital imagery works.
