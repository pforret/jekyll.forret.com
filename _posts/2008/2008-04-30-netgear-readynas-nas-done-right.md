One of the most popular pages on this blog is about a storage device that has a lot of enemies and few defenders, the [SC101](http://blog.forret.com/2006/07/netgear-sc-101-urgent-support-required/). It&#8217;s Windows-only, uses a proprietary filesystem and when (not if) it starts crashing, just say bye-bye to your data. The product didn&#8217;t do much good for Netgear&#8217;s reputation. So when Netgear offered me the opportunity to test a real NAS solution, I agreed. So they sent me the [ReadyNAS NV+](http://www.netgear.com/Products/Storage/ReadyNASNVPlus.aspx).

<!--more-->The ReadyNAS is a 4-bay network-attached storage device with a nice set of features. Yes, it does storage, but it also has an FTP server, an iTunes streaming server and uPnP (Universal Plug-and-Play: works with Microsoft products like Windows XP and Xbox). I&#8217;ve been able to use one for over a month and in short: I&#8217;m probably going to buy one.

**PRO:**

  * it&#8217;s big: 4 bays gives you a max size of 4TB. That should do for a while.
  * it&#8217;s silent. It ran in my living room, and the noise was hardly noticeable.
  * it&#8217;s fast (when connected to a 100Mbps client, I reached speeds between 7.3 MB/s and 8 MB/s &#8211; the theoretical max for 100Mbps is 12.5 MB/s)
  * it&#8217;s robust: I experienced no downtime, but then again, 1 month is only a month.
  * it&#8217;s full-featured: the streaming protocols and in the latest firmware, the BitTorrent client, make it very flexible.
  * it&#8217;s scalable: the X-RAID technology lets you pop in new disks and scale automatically (without reformatting)

**CON:**

  * price: it&#8217;s not the cheapest NAS on the market (e.g. LaCie has a comparbale device, but it does not support all the streaming/torrent protocols that ReadyNAS has)
  * proprietary: I&#8217;m not sure how easy it is to recover data from an X-RAID formatted disk set. I don&#8217;t think you can mount them in a Linux system and recover the data.

I also received the latest Storage Central (successor of the SC101) to test, but I never opened the box. The trauma of the previous one was still too big.

In any case, it seems Netgear finally made a good choice by buying Infrant, with the ReadyNAS product line.
