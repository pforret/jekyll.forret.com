My iPod Nano has gone into the equivalent of a coma. No matter what you do with the &#8220;HOLD&#8221; switch, it remains in a locked state. So while you can see when you connect it to a PC that the music is still there and the battery still works, you cannot use it, since the play-button (as well as all the others) does not respond.

Switching frantically between HOLD ON/HOLD OFF does not work, pushing excessively towards &#8220;HOLD OFF&#8221; (to the left) does not work. Is there a way to disable the HOLD button, or is that a mechanical connection that is not managed by the firmware? Can you open an iPod Nano and &#8216;clean the contact&#8217;?

The only other option I see is to buy a docking-station-with-speakers that includes a remote control. But why spend another 100â‚¬ on a 4GB iPod that doesn&#8217;t work properly &#8230;

Any ideas?
