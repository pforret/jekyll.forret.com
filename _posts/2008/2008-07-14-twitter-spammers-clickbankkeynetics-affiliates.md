I&#8217;ve been experimenting with Twitter a couple of times, and one of the results, the F[M Brussel Live](http://twitter.com/fmbrussel) playlist twitter bot, seems to be rather popular. I get a couple of subscriptions per day. But recently they&#8217;re almost all of the form \[name of girl\]\[number of 2 &#8211; 4 digits\]. This is what they look like:

<!--more-->Rather suspicious, right? So I started checking some of them out:

[<img  src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3123/2667936721_a935bdab4a.jpg" alt="Clickbank spammer ex. 3" width="500" height="236" />](http://www.flickr.com/photos/pforret/2667936721/ "Clickbank spammer ex. 3 by PeterForret, on Flickr")  
[<img  src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3093/2667937175_4651612c1d.jpg" alt="Clickbank spammer ex. 6" width="500" height="275" />](http://www.flickr.com/photos/pforret/2667937175/ "Clickbank spammer ex. 6 by PeterForret, on Flickr")

Most of them were similar: very few updates (1-2), a lot of &#8216;Following&#8217; and hardly any &#8216;Followers&#8217;. And, most importantly, a link to the same website in their profile: &#8216;the6figureteam.com&#8217;. This has all the looks of a spammer at work. The &#8216;6 figure&#8217; website is a promotion for a DIY kit to convert your car so it runs on water.  
[<img  src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3048/2668757624_13b6b8f6e7.jpg" alt="Run your car on water" width="473" height="500" />](http://www.flickr.com/photos/pforret/2668757624/ "Run your car on water by PeterForret, on Flickr")  
(in the small print you can read it&#8217;s actually water AND gas, not just water.)

The owner of the domain cannot be traced (Domains-by-proxy). But the site points to a redirection service, which is run by Clickbank:  
[<img  src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3229/2668757908_4977144c68.jpg" alt="Clickbank affiliate program" width="500" height="434" />](http://www.flickr.com/photos/pforret/2668757908/ "Clickbank affiliate program by PeterForret, on Flickr")  
Now we&#8217;re getting somewhere: Clickbank is a company from Boise, Idaho.  
[<img  src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3212/2668758350_98b91ea542_o.jpg" alt="Clickbank registration" width="360" height="317" />](http://www.flickr.com/photos/pforret/2668758350/ "Clickbank registration by PeterForret, on Flickr")  
It also operates as Keynetics or Click Sales Inc. What they do is described in a lawsuit they got for &#8216;regular&#8217; email spamming:  
[<img  src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3034/2668758252_8524c7bc78.jpg" alt="Keynetics/Clickbank lawsuit" width="500" height="298" />](http://www.flickr.com/photos/pforret/2668758252/ "Keynetics/Clickbank lawsuit by PeterForret, on Flickr")

Apparently the company is quite big, they allow low-tech customers get money for referrals, which means a lot of people without scrupules will use it to let other suckers click on their links. Colleagues of theirs: Tradedoubler, CommissionJunction, Affili.net.

Who is to blame for the spam Twitter accounts? Clickbank just runs the technical redirection platform, Centemax (11K hits in Google all of them spam/landing pages) just set up a commision scheme for a &#8216;Run your car on water&#8217; product, and the affiliates just used that scheme to try to make money. Capitalism at work, right?

**SOLUTION: better detection**

The best thing Twitter could do is enhance their detection:

  * if a large number of new twitter accounts are created with the same URL in their profile: SPAM
  * if they have almost no own updates, no followers, but they&#8217;re following 5000 other accounts: SPAM
  * if the URL they refer to is a page full of ClickBank redirects: SPAM
  * &#8230;
