Come on, I can understand [Sourceforge](http://www.sourceforge.net) needs the Adsense revenue, but this is going too far. A huge 450 x 400 blue advertisement is blocking access to most download links on a Sourceforge download page, and there is no way to make it disappear, no [X] button in the top right or a &#8220;hide this&#8221; link. 

The biggest square ads I can see in the [Adsense overview page](https://www.google.com/adsense/adformats) are 336 x 280 (&#8220;large rectangle&#8221;), so this must be some kind of special ad. It renders the page virtually useless. Drop it, already.

BTW: more flexible screwing, anyone?
