Post #1 in this [bash benchmark](/tag/bash-benchmark/) series, 
measuring the **throughput** (MB/s) of common **bash text manipulations**.

## Cutting the first 20 characters from each line

![Bash benchmarks](/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/benchmark.cut.jpg)

### Using `cut`
* the most common way to do this, is probably `cut -c1-20`
  (to cut the first 20 characters of every line, and delete the rest)

### Using `awk`
* another way is to use the swiss army knife of string/line manipulation **awk**: `awk '{print substr($0,1,20)}'`

### Using bash variable
* you could also do character cutting during variable expansion: `${variable:0:20}`

## Benchmark [via pforret/bash_benchmarks](https://github.com/pforret/bash_benchmarks) 

> **TL;DR: The fastest way to cut N chars from each line is `awk`!
> It is more than 10 times faster than `cut` or variable expansion!**

### Cut first 20 chars: using `awk`
```
Command: 'awk {print substr($0,1,20)}'
Result: '0123456789012345678901234567890123456789' => '01234567890123456789'
```
* **80 msec -- 125.1 MB/s**

### Cut first 20 chars: using `cut`
```
Command: 'cut -c1-20'
Result: '0123456789012345678901234567890123456789' => '01234567890123456789'
```
* 1040 msec -- 9.6 MB/s

### Cut first 20 chars: using `bash`
```
Command: 'bash -c while read line ; do echo ${line:0:20} ; done'
Result: '0123456789012345678901234567890123456789' => '01234567890123456789'
```
* 796 msec -- 12.6 MB/s

So the winner is `awk`, by far. 
You will see in the rest of this series, that this is not the last time.
