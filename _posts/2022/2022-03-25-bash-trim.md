Post #3 in this [bash benchmark](/tag/bash-benchmark/) series,
measuring the speed of common **bash text manipulations**.

> Update: I now have developed [bash benchmarking](https://github.com/pforret/bash_benchmarks) for both **throughput** (MB/s) and **invocation** (ops/sec) speed in my project, combined with all kinds of other improvements, so the content in this article was updated [2022-04-08]

## Trimming leading/trailing whitespace

![Bash benchmarks](/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/benchmark.trim.jpg)

This is about the removing of spaces in the beginning and at the end of a line, within a bash script.

### using `awk`
This has been my go-to for trimming strings, after I picked it up from [stackoverflow.com](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9985528/how-can-i-trim-white-space-from-a-variable-in-awk).
The long version there
```shell
awk '
    function ltrim(s) { sub(/^[ \t\r\n]+/, "", s); return s }
    function rtrim(s) { sub(/[ \t\r\n]+$/, "", s); return s }
    function trim(s) { return rtrim(ltrim(s)); }
    {return trim($0)}
'
```
can be condensed to a one-liner: 
```shell
Command: awk '{sub(/^[ \t\r\n]+/, ""); sub(/[ \t\r\n]+$/, ""); print}'
Before: '   This is sentence #1
       And this is #2    '
After : 'This is sentence #1
And this is #2'
```

### using `sed`
for the sed version, we need to it to perform 2 substitute operations in a row:
```shell
Command: sed -e 's/^[[:space:]]*//' -e 's/[[:space:]]*$//'
Before: '   This is sentence #1
       And this is #2    '
After : 'This is sentence #1
And this is #2'
```

### using `xargs`
It is not the main function of `xargs`, but one side effect it has can be used to remove whitespace. However, it does not work well on multi-line inputs, as it will join all lines in 1.
```shell
Command: xargs
Before: '   This is sentence #1
       And this is #2    '
After : 'This is sentence #1 And this is #2' ## on 1 line instead of 2
```

### using `php`
PHP has a trim() function built in, so we can use it in a while loop:
```shell
Command: php -r 'while($f = fgets(STDIN)){ printf("%s\n", trim($f)) ; }'
Before: '   This is sentence #1
       And this is #2    '
After : 'This is sentence #1
And this is #2'
```

### using variable expansion
There is a way to do this in pure bash via [variable expansion](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/369758/how-to-trim-whitespace-from-a-bash-variable).

```shell
trim() {
    local var="$*"
    # remove leading whitespace characters
    var="${var#"${var%%[![:space:]]*}"}"
    # remove trailing whitespace characters
    var="${var%"${var##*[![:space:]]}"}"   
    printf '%s' "$var"
}
```

I've added this to my benchmark as follows:
```shell
Command: '$(line="${line#"${line%%[![:space:]]*}"}"; echo "${line%"${line##*[![:space:]]}"}")'
Before: '   This is sentence #1
       And this is #2    '
After : 'This is sentence #1        And this is #2' ## also this method cannot manage multiline inputs
```


## Benchmark [via pforret/bash_benchmarks](https://github.com/pforret/bash_benchmarks)

> I will focus here on the relative speeds compared to each other, the absolute speeds depend on your machine, and my 2021 MacBookPro M1 16" is quite fast. I've tested these benchmarks on a Ubuntu-on-Windows WSL1 environment, and that is wayyyyyy slower.

| method      | throughput | invocation   |
|-------------|-----------|--------------|
| awk         | 312 MB/s  | 255 ops/sec  |
| sed         | 56 MB/S   | 903 ops/sec  |
| xargs       | 21 MB/s   | 623 ops/sec  |
| php         | 267 MB/s  | 61 op/sec    | 
| ${line#...} | 5 MB/s    | 1650 ops/sec |

Some lessons from these benchmarks:
* invocation speed for `awk` (+- 250 ops/sec), `sed` (+- 900 ops/sec) and `php` (+- 60 ops/sec) remains stable for most of these bash benchmarks. It will be interesting to see if this changes if e.g. `awk` get a lot of instructions, like we will see with _romanization_ of text (soon). 
* the last variable expansion method might be fast to execute for 1 line, but no one remembers such a complex command. It's hard to beat the simplicity of `$(<<< $input xargs)`

So what is my recommendation for **trimming spaces from lines**?
* if you need to trim a **single line of text**, use `xargs`. It's just so easy.
* if you need to trim all **lines in a file**, use `awk`
