I am doing some really cool research lately concerning video conversion and one of the issues I ran into, concerns **infrared imaging**. In short: all the &#8216;cool&#8217; thermographic (colour is dependent on radiated temperature) images are in color, and the images you get from cheap IR cameras is black and white. How do you convert the B/W into colour? 

First of all: we&#8217;re talking about two different imaging technologies: the &#8216;real&#8217; thermographic cameras measure only infra-red (not visible) light, are very precise, expensive and are created by companies like [FLIR](http://www.flir.com/). They make the cameras that you might have seen in [CSI](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0eU-jR-POg). <figure class="wp-block-image size-large">

<img  width="500" height="377" src="http://blog.forret.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/example_flir1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1342" srcset="https://blog.forret.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/example_flir1.jpg 500w, https://blog.forret.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/example_flir1-300x226.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" />  Example of a &#8216;real&#8217; thermographic image   

On the other hand, you have the cheaper webcam/IP-cam devices that have &#8216;night-vision&#8217;. This means that, in addition to all visible light, the cameras are also sensitive to a part of the IR spectrum, and with some additional IR-lighting, one is capable of seeing in very dark places. They produce B/W images or colour, but then sometimes they show green grass as a bit purple/pink. 

What I was trying to do is convert a &#8216;cheap&#8217; B/W video into the coloured thermographic equivalent, but without expecting that e.g. orange will always mean 38°-39°. Since we start from a mixed visible/IR light video, brightness does not correlate perfectly with temperature. Still, the end result might be easier to interpret. 

So this is my source material: a Foscam FI8918W video from [Youtube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xvrcb5Pqam0): two cats playing in a kitchen. <figure class="wp-block-image size-large">

<img  width="480" height="360" src="http://blog.forret.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/thermo0_0061.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1343" srcset="https://blog.forret.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/thermo0_0061.png 480w, https://blog.forret.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/thermo0_0061-300x225.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" />   

**FIRST TRY**  
I find some inspiration from a guy who did something similar with ImageMagick. The dark/cold areas are supposed to be black/blue, the medium areas more green, then going to yellow, orange, red and white. This seems like a job for the [FFMPEG video filter](http://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-filters.html).

I use the &#8216;curves&#8217; filter and try first with really strong contrast colours:<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized">

**SECOND TRY**  
The color scheme is kind of OK,&nbsp;but we lose a lot of detail (the cats become hard to distinguish). So then I try a more gradual approach: <figure class="wp-block-image size-large">

<img  width="480" height="360" src="http://blog.forret.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/thermo2_0061.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1345" srcset="https://blog.forret.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/thermo2_0061.png 480w, https://blog.forret.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/thermo2_0061-300x225.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" />   

And this is rather OK. I like it. The cats come out nice. For the record: the curves used are approximately this: <figure class="wp-block-image size-large">
