> Update Sept 2017: FreshDesk just release a new product [FreshTeam](https://www.freshworks.com/applicant-tracking/) that does exactly what I specified below.

I recently found myself in the position of having to [hire a new colleague](http://www.brightfish.be/nl/topics/jobs-nl/) for the first time in a long while. This means, I get lots of emails with attached PDFs from people I&#8217;ve never heard of, I have to filter out the good ones, invite those and send a thank-you-email to all the other ones. I then evaluate the candidates after their first conversation, maybe invite them for a second interview. A classical funnel workflow. Surely this can be automated and optimised, I told myself (_as I caught myself adding colours to Outlook mails in my &#8216;Applicants&#8217; folder, in order not to forget who I invited and/or answered_.)

So I checked what SaaS vendors there are in this solution space, which is called &#8220;ATS&#8221; for [Applicant Tracking Systems](https://www.datanyze.com/market-share/recruitment/).

(Mind you, most of these services do more than just ATS, they try to automate hiring, on-boarding, contracting, &#8230; So the prices are not always comparable)

Then I was thinking how I could build an ATS for myself using existing software components/services. A software that can process incoming emails, analyse them and forward them to a person who should take care of follow-up. A system that has standard reply templates, that has an escalation process, that will show you what emails still have to be treated. That sounds just like the [Freshdesk](https://freshdesk.com) I&#8217;m using at work for technical support!

Imagine I redirect all emails that I receive on to jobs@mycompany.com to mycompany@myhelpdesk.com. Every applicant becomes a ticket. He gets an email confirming his application was well received and will be treated by the hiring manager.  The manager in question sees a dashboard of unanswered mails that he has to go through and either decline (template mails) or accept (standard mail with contact details and date propositions). I bet that I could start with a basic Freshdesk set-up, spend a day customising the mail templates, configuring the question categories as company departments etc, and I&#8217;d already have an ATS that does a pretty good job. Maybe when I need to hire ten more &#8230;
