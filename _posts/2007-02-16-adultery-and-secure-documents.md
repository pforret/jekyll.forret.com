I get an email from CertiPost, a daughter company of the Belgacom/Belgian Post, that bears the title &#8220;_You had an unwanted visitor last night_&#8220;. When one clicks on the link, one has to give the name of one&#8217;s partner, best friend and favourite sport. The result is a somewhat customized movie about a wife who cheats on her husband, or actually, your wife cheating on you.

This obviously is a trial to make a viral video. They&#8217;ve made some mistakes though:

  * You can only personalize the movie for yourself, you cannot forward a copy personalized for a friend. That would have really made it viral.
  * I fail to see why &#8220;_Your wife is cheating on you_&#8221; would make the subject want to buy a product/service, expect if it concerns lethal weapons or a private detective.
  * The contrast between a movie that is trying to be cheeky and a company that is anything but cheeky &#8211; an institution that tries to sell you security services &#8211; makes it untrustworthy
