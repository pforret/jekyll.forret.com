For some reason this &#8220;web&#8221; conference has been transformed into a political rally. 

  * First, this morning [Shimon Peres](http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1994/peres-bio.html) shows up to talk about world peace.
  * This afternoon, out of the blue, we&#8217;re supposed to welcome [Nicholas Sarkozy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolas_Sarkozy) (UMP).
  * And equally unexpected we just had a political statement by his political counterpart [François Bayrou](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran%C3%A7ois_Bayrou) (UDF)

This bothers me a lot:

  * [Loic Lemeur](http://www.loiclemeur.com/) might have political ambitions, right in time for the French Presidential race, but that does not mean he has to turn a conference about technology and social software into a political forum
  * I have tremendous respect for Mr. Peres, but this is not the time nor place to have this kind of presentation.
  * I did not pay over &euro;600 (fee/hotel/travel) to come and listen to self-involved French politicians talk about why they want to run for president
  * The whole conference scheme has been changed and compressed for allowing hours of (for most of us) irrelevant monologue
  * Loic was proud that [55% of attendees were not French](http://www.leweb3.com/leweb3/2006/12/36_countries_co.html), but then he gives the stage to French candidates speaking French
