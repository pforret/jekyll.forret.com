I was born near Roeselare, in West-Vlaanderen, and every now and then I go back to my roots. I drive over Gent and Kortrijk and on the way I&#8217;m always curious to see what kind of advertising the guys from [TVH](http://www.tvh.be) have put up this time. For they are clearly guys, in the TVH marketing department.

Exhibit #1, May 2006:  
[<img loading="lazy" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2332/2489737188_9cb5bf0bdb.jpg" alt="TVH: we lift almost everything" width="500" height="276" />](http://www.flickr.com/photos/pforret/2489737188/ "TVH: we lift almost everything by PeterForret, on Flickr")

<!--more-->Exhibit #2, August 2007:

[![Big or small, we lift it all](http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1285/760317859_d2759355f6.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/slicktrix/760317859/ "Big or small, we lift it all by PeterForret, on Flickr")

Exhibit #3, May 2008:

[<img loading="lazy" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2131/2488906023_9c7a7ab948.jpg" alt="TVH: full service" width="500" height="265" />](http://www.flickr.com/photos/pforret/2488906023/ "TVH: full service by PeterForret, on Flickr")

A psychoanalyst would have hours of analysis pleasure on these beauties. The mammary image in the first picture clearly links forklift trucks (which is what they sell, by the way) to a homely feeling. There is also an element of surprise: forklifts can&#8217;t lift boobs?? Who would have thought? The second demonstrates your basic castration fear (Freud turns in his grave and shouts: &#8220;I thought of that one&#8221;) and the last one assures you that asian efficiency will be used to service &#8230; whatever (insert misogynist joke with &#8216;screw&#8217; and &#8216;shaft&#8217;).

A look at [TVH&#8217;s who&#8217;s-who](http://www.tvh.com/newen2/who_is_who/sales.html) indicates that the responsible person for the campaigns would be sales & marketing director L. Maertens. Keep excercising that innuendo muscle, Mr Maertens!
