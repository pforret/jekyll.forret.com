Understanding the original track inside and out is the foundation of a great remix. In this second part of our remix series, we'll explore how to analyze and deconstruct your source material using Ableton Live v12's powerful tools, including the game-changing stem separation feature introduced in version 12.3.

By the end of this tutorial, you'll know exactly what makes the original track tick, and you'll have isolated all the elements you need to create something entirely new.

## The Power of Stem Separation in Live 12.3

One of the most significant additions to Ableton Live 12.3 is the built-in AI-powered stem separation feature. This tool can extract individual elements from a full stereo mixdown, giving you access to isolated vocals, drums, bass, and other instruments even when you don't have official stems.

### How Stem Separation Works

Ableton's stem separation uses machine learning algorithms trained on thousands of songs to identify and isolate different musical elements. While not perfect, the technology has reached a point where the results are remarkably clean and usable for production work.

### Using the Stem Separation Feature

Here's how to extract stems from a full mixdown:

1. **Import your track** into an audio track in Arrangement View
2. **Right-click on the audio clip** in the Clip View
3. **Select "Extract Audio"** from the menu
4. **Choose your separation options**:
   - **2-stem**: Separates into "Harmonic" and "Percussive" elements
   - **4-stem**: Separates into "Vocals", "Drums", "Bass", and "Other"
   - **5-stem**: Adds "Piano" as a separate category

5. **Wait for processing** - This happens in the background, and you can continue working
6. **Access the results** - New audio clips will be created on separate tracks

### Choosing the Right Separation Mode

**When to use 2-stem separation:**
- Quick experimentation
- Isolating rhythmic vs. melodic content
- Creating acapella versions (vocals are in "harmonic")
- Building instrumental versions (use "percussive" + some "harmonic")

**When to use 4-stem separation:**
- Most remix projects
- When you need clean vocal extraction
- Isolating the bass line for replacement
- Getting clean drums for layering

**When to use 5-stem separation:**
- Piano-heavy tracks
- Jazz, classical, or ballad remixes
- When the piano is a key element you want to manipulate separately

### Quality Considerations

Stem separation works best when:
- The source audio is high quality (320kbps MP3 minimum, WAV/FLAC ideal)
- Elements are clearly defined in the mix
- The track doesn't have extreme processing or lo-fi aesthetic

You may notice some artifacts:
- **Vocal bleed** into other stems (especially breathy consonants)
- **Cymbals and hi-hats** bleeding into melodic stems
- **Sub-bass** sometimes remaining in the drums stem
- **Reverb tails** split across multiple stems

These artifacts are usually manageable and can even add character to your remix. In many cases, light EQ or additional processing can clean them up.

### Comparison with Original Stems

If you have access to official stems, the stem separation feature is still valuable:
- **Extract hidden elements** - Sometimes the full mix has elements not in the stem pack
- **Quick experimentation** - Faster than loading individual stems
- **Reference checking** - Compare your stem separation with official stems to train your ear

## Analyzing the Song Structure

Before you start cutting and rearranging, you need a clear map of how the original track is constructed.

### Creating a Structural Overview

Use Ableton's locators to mark every section:

1. **Listen through the entire track** with fresh ears
2. **Identify major sections** and press **Cmd+E** (Mac) / **Ctrl+E** (Windows) to create locators at boundaries
3. **Name each section** by double-clicking the locator

Typical song structures include:

**Pop/EDM Structure:**
- Intro (8-16 bars)
- Verse 1 (8-16 bars)
- Pre-Chorus (4-8 bars)
- Chorus (8-16 bars)
- Verse 2 (8-16 bars)
- Pre-Chorus (4-8 bars)
- Chorus (8-16 bars)
- Bridge (8-16 bars)
- Chorus / Outro (8-32 bars)

**Club/Electronic Structure:**
- Intro (16-32 bars)
- Build (8-16 bars)
- Drop 1 (16-32 bars)
- Breakdown (16-32 bars)
- Build (8-16 bars)
- Drop 2 (16-32 bars)
- Outro (16-32 bars)

### Analyzing Energy Flow

Music works through tension and release. Map the energy curve:

1. **Identify high-energy sections** - Usually choruses/drops
2. **Identify low-energy sections** - Verses, breakdowns
3. **Note transition techniques** - Fills, risers, filter sweeps, drum breaks

Understanding this flow is crucial because your remix should create its own compelling energy arc, whether it follows the original pattern or subverts it entirely.

### Counting Bars and Phrases

Electronic music typically works in multiples of 4 or 8 bars:

1. **Enable the metronome** if needed
2. **Count along** - "1, 2, 3, 4" for each bar
3. **Mark phrase lengths** - Most musical phrases are 4, 8, 16, or 32 bars
4. **Note irregularities** - Some tracks have unusual phrase lengths (6 bars, 12 bars) which create tension

This information guides your arrangement decisions. If the original verse is 16 bars, you might make yours 8 or 32 bars for contrast.

## Identifying Key Musical Elements

Every track has core elements that define its character. Your job is to identify them.

### The Four Core Elements

Most music can be broken down into:

1. **Rhythm** - Drums, percussion, rhythmic loops
2. **Harmony** - Chords, pads, sustained notes
3. **Melody** - Lead lines, hooks, riffs
4. **Vocals** - Lyrics, ad-libs, vocal chops

### Using Solo and Mute Strategically

To isolate and understand each element:

1. **Solo individual tracks** - Press **S** on a track to solo it
2. **Mute combinations** - Press **M** to mute, leaving others playing
3. **Listen for interactions** - How does the bass relate to the kick? How do synths complement vocals?

### Taking Notes

Create a text file or use Ableton's Info Text (View > Info Text) to document:

- **Key sounds**: "Plucky synth in chorus", "Filtered piano in breakdown"
- **Processing details**: "Vocals have long reverb", "Bass is sidechain compressed"
- **Unique elements**: "Vinyl crackle in intro", "Telephone effect on verse 2 vocal"

These notes become a creative resource. You might:
- Keep certain elements unchanged (signature sounds)
- Completely replace others (standard drum patterns)
- Transform them creatively (turn a synth into a chopped rhythm)

## Determining Key and Scale

Knowing the musical key helps you add new elements that harmonize with the original.

### Using Ableton's Tuner

If you have a melodic or harmonic stem isolated:

1. **Add the Tuner device** to the track (from Audio Effects)
2. **Solo that track** and play a sustained note or chord
3. **Observe the note reading** - The Tuner displays the pitch (e.g., "C", "F#", "Bb")
4. **Test multiple sections** - Verify the key is consistent throughout (most songs stay in one key)

### External Tools for Key Detection

For more comprehensive analysis:

- **Mixed In Key** - Industry-standard DJ/producer tool for key detection
- **Keyfinder** - Free, open-source key detection software
- **Tunebat.com** - Online key and BPM analyzer

These tools typically report keys in **Camelot notation** or **traditional notation** (e.g., "A minor", "F# major").

### Identifying the Scale

Most Western music uses:

- **Major scale** - Bright, happy, uplifting feeling
- **Minor scale** - Dark, sad, emotional feeling

Some electronic music uses:
- **Harmonic minor** - Dramatic, Middle Eastern flavor
- **Melodic minor** - Jazz, sophisticated sound
- **Pentatonic** - Simple, folk-like, versatile

You don't need perfect pitch. Just knowing "this is in A minor" allows you to:
- Add basslines using A minor notes
- Choose synth presets in A minor
- Create melodies that fit harmonically

### Transposing for Creative Effect

Once you know the original key, you might:
- **Pitch the entire track up/down** for different energy (common in club edits)
- **Change the key** of your remix entirely by pitch-shifting elements
- **Keep vocals at original pitch** but change the music behind them

## Extracting Specific Elements

Now that you understand the track, let's extract the parts you want to work with.

### Copying Sections to New Clips

To isolate a specific phrase:

1. **Select the audio region** in Arrangement View by clicking and dragging
2. **Press Cmd+E** (Mac) / **Ctrl+E** (Windows) to split at the selection boundaries
3. **Press Cmd+C** (Mac) / **Ctrl+C** (Windows) to copy
4. **Create a new audio track** and paste (Cmd+V / Ctrl+V)

This creates a new clip containing only that section.

### Converting to MIDI (Melody Detection)

Ableton can convert audio melodies to MIDI:

1. **Select a melodic audio clip** (vocal phrase, synth lead, etc.)
2. **Right-click the clip** and select **Convert Harmony to New MIDI Track** or **Convert Melody to New MIDI Track**
3. **Ableton analyzes the pitch** and creates a MIDI clip
4. **Clean up the MIDI** - The detection isn't perfect, so you'll need to edit notes

This is incredibly powerful for:
- Re-playing a vocal melody with a synth
- Extracting a bassline to replace with your own sound
- Creating harmonies from monophonic lines

### Slicing to MIDI (Rhythmic Sampling)

For percussive or rhythmic material:

1. **Select the audio clip**
2. **Right-click and select "Slice to New MIDI Track"**
3. **Choose a slicing method**:
   - **Transient** - Automatically detects hits
   - **Beat** - Slices based on rhythmic divisions
   - **Manual** - You create slice markers

4. **Ableton creates a new MIDI track** with Simpler or Drum Rack containing each slice
5. **Play slices chromatically** on your MIDI keyboard

This technique is essential for:
- Re-grooving drums
- Creating stutter effects
- Building rhythmic variations from vocal phrases

### Exporting Elements for External Processing

Sometimes you'll want to process elements in external tools:

1. **Select the audio clip** or region you want to export
2. **Go to File > Export Audio/Video**
3. **Choose settings**:
   - **Rendered Track**: Select the specific track
   - **Sample Rate**: Match your project (usually 44.1 or 48 kHz)
   - **File Type**: WAV for lossless quality

4. **Process externally** in tools like iZotope RX, Melodyne, or Auto-Tune
5. **Re-import** the processed audio back into Ableton

## Using MIDI and Audio Effects for Analysis

Ableton's effects aren't just for mixing - they're analytical tools.

### Spectrum Analyzer (EQ Eight)

To visualize frequency content:

1. **Add EQ Eight** to any track
2. **Click the small waveform icon** in the bottom-left to enable spectrum analysis
3. **Observe which frequencies are prominent**:
   - **Sub-bass**: 20-60 Hz
   - **Bass**: 60-250 Hz
   - **Low-mids**: 250-500 Hz
   - **Mids**: 500 Hz-2 kHz
   - **High-mids**: 2-6 kHz
   - **Highs**: 6-20 kHz

This helps you understand:
- How much low-end is in the original (important for club remixes)
- Where vocals sit in the spectrum
- Frequency gaps you can fill with new elements

### Auto Filter for Sweeping Analysis

Use a resonant filter to "scan" through frequencies:

1. **Add Auto Filter** to a stem
2. **Set Filter Type** to Band Pass
3. **Increase Resonance** (Q) to narrow the band
4. **Slowly sweep the Frequency control**

You'll hear isolated frequency ranges, revealing:
- Hidden background elements
- Sub-bass content
- Resonant frequencies that define the sound

### Erosion for Texture Analysis

The Erosion device (in Audio Effects > Degradation) can help you understand rhythmic textures:

1. **Add Erosion** to a melodic or harmonic stem
2. **Adjust the Frequency control**
3. **Listen to how it affects the tone**

This reveals the harmonic structure and can inspire creative transformations.

## Taking Notes on Arrangement Flow

Document how elements enter and exit the arrangement.

### Element Entry Points

Make a list showing when each element appears:

```
0:00-0:15 - Intro: Pad, light percussion, vocal sample
0:15-0:30 - Add: Kick, bass
0:30-1:00 - Add: Full drums, clap/snare
1:00-1:30 - Verse 1: Add vocals, remove some percussion
1:30-2:00 - Pre-Chorus: Add synth stab, build energy
2:00-2:30 - Chorus: All elements, full energy
```

### Transition Techniques Inventory

Note how the producer moves between sections:

- **Drum fills** - Classic transition, usually 1-2 bars before section change
- **Risers** - White noise or synth sweeps that build tension
- **Downlifters** - Opposite of risers, create a drop effect
- **Filter sweeps** - Low-pass closing into breakdown, high-pass opening into drop
- **Silence/Drops** - Everything cuts out for 1-2 beats before slamming back
- **Reverse effects** - Reversed cymbals, vocals, or instruments leading into a section

Your remix can use similar techniques or deliberately contrast with the original.

### Note Unique Production Tricks

Every track has signature moments:

- Vocal stutters or glitches
- Unexpected genre shifts
- Creative use of silence
- Unusual sounds (glass breaking, nature sounds, dialogue samples)
- Processing artifacts (bit-crushing, vinyl crackle, tape saturation)

These details can inspire your remix approach. You might:
- Amplify them (make the glitch even more prominent)
- Remove them entirely (clean, modern approach)
- Replace them with your own signature sounds

## Setting Up Your Analysis Session

Create a dedicated "analysis" Live Set:

1. **Save a copy of your project** as "Track Name (Remix) - Analysis"
2. **Create a dedicated Analysis track group**
3. **Add text clips or use Arrangement View markers** with notes
4. **Use colors** to highlight interesting moments

This reference session is separate from your actual remix work, keeping your production environment clean while preserving all your analytical insights.

## Preparing for Part 3

You now have:

- ✓ Isolated stems (either official or via stem separation)
- ✓ Clear understanding of the song structure
- ✓ Identified key musical elements and their roles
- ✓ Determined the key and scale
- ✓ Extracted specific elements for manipulation
- ✓ Documented arrangement flow and transition techniques

This analytical foundation prepares you for the creative phase. In **Part 3: Creative Rearrangement and Manipulation**, we'll use all this knowledge to start transforming the original material. You'll learn chopping techniques, creative warping, time-stretching, pitch-shifting, and how to build your own unique arrangement from the deconstructed elements.

The deeper your analysis, the more informed and creative your remix decisions will be. You're not just randomly cutting and pasting - you're making deliberate choices based on understanding what makes the original track work.
