I want to start publishing on this blog about a side project I have been working on for a while: 
## [churlie.com](https://www.churlie.com)

What is Churlie.com? It's a SaaS (Software-as-a-Service) for managing an inventory of websites. It's the lovechild of a CRM, but for websites, and a notification service for important changes to those websites.

[I registered the domain name in March 2018](https://www.churlie.com/about/2018/03/05/churlie/), but the idea was already for a while in my head. I had been discussing with my friend [Ine](https://www.matuvu.nu/) about the pains of managing several dozens of websites and web projects for oneself and for customers. While you are working on something, you have a good idea of how you organised the domain registration, the hosting, the CDN (Content Delivery Network), the CMS (Content Management System), ... But after a couple of years, when you've been working on so many other projects, it's hard to recall how the whole thing was set up. Even more if it's not just a personal project of your own, but one you did for a client, with 3 freelancers and John, their Marketing Manager, who's no longer there.

> Wouldn't it be great if there was a service that could help you keep track of all this? Like a [InfiniteWP service](https://infinitewp.com/) on steroids, but not just for WordPress sites? Where you can assign assets to certain people, just like a project management tool. That would alert you if important changes happen, like an uptime monitoring service.

## The name?

The name Churlie comes from ‘checking URLs’. It also might be inspired by the following quote from Airplane.

## Status?

Well, it's far from finished :-) But I got a boost of energy from attending Barcamp Izegem last month. That's when I decided to speed things up and to also start '[building in the open](https://www.indiehackers.com/post/building-in-the-open-buildintheopen-51b3ae613b)': write about what I'm doing, to see if people get how Churlie would make their life easier.
