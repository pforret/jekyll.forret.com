Yahoo just announced that they now have live traffic information on their mapping service:

> In a milestone for Internet-based traffic services, Yahoo! has beefed up its existing [mapping services](http://maps.yahoo.com) to allow customers to plot a route from one local destination to another, and overlay traffic data such as road speeds and potential delays.

When you live in a city like Brussels, you know how unpredictable and unnerving traffic can be. Here in Belgium we also have some services that give up-to-date traffic info: 

  * [radio1.be](http://www.radio1.be/radio1_master/verkeer/r1_verkeer_overzicht/index.html) gives some info on Brussels and Antwerp in text-format (not much really) 
  * [verkeerscentrum.be](http://www.verkeerscentrum.be/verkeersinfo/default) gives an map of Flanders and traffic condition for the main arteries 
  * [vab.be](http://www.vab.be/NL/viaVAB/Belgie/default.aspx) shows the traffic map info of the whole of Belgium, based on police information. 
  * [wegeninfo.be](http://www.wegeninfo.be/) also gets info from the Federal Police and show it in a blog-like text-way (reverse chronological). 

In France they have something much better: on [parisrhinrhone.com](http://www.parisrhinrhone.com/home.asp) they have 10 webcams watching the Paris/Lyon/Dijon motorways and anyone can see the live feed. Sometimes a picture is worth a thousand words!

[William Beaty](http://www.amasci.com/amateur/traffic/traffic1.html) has his theory on how defensive driving helps solve traffic congestion.

> That&#8217;s the whole point. We WANT people to merge ahead of us before that other lane comes to an end. If I fear that someone will leap into the space ahead of me, or if this makes me resentful or angry, then I close up ranks and prevent everyone from merging. If I try to become the &#8220;vengance police&#8221; and punish the cheaters who zoom ahead, then I close up ranks and stop all merges. Closed ranks create traffic jams. **&#8220;Cheaters&#8221; don&#8217;t trigger traffic jams, it&#8217;s the people who try to punish the cheaters who do it**.  
> Lane-jumpers are not the real problem. Traffic jams are commonly caused by people who attempt to punish the lane-jumpers by eliminating all spaces! In the merge-jam animations, the goal isn&#8217;t to maintain the empty space under any circumstance. The goal is to ALLOW PEOPLE TO MERGE AHEAD OF US! Closing up the ranks is what produces that jam in the animation.
