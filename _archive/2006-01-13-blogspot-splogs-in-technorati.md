For some reason, if I search for [&#8220;baeyens&#8221; on Technorati](http://www.technorati.com/search/baeyens) (sorry, [John](http://www.baeyens.net)), all I get is a list of splogs (spam blogs). The first &#8216;real&#8217; result is somewhere at #50, drowned between WEBCAM, CAMERA and PHONE CARD splogs.

[<img  src="http://static.flickr.com/43/85968015_b4b44b233d.jpg" width="468" height="500" alt="Technorati splog results" />](http://www.flickr.com/photos/pforret/85968015/ "Photo Sharing")

They all have the same characteristics:

  * all on [Blogger](http://www.blogger.com)&#8216;s blogspot.com 
  * post title is up to three spam words in upper case 
  * blog title is up to three spam words in lower case 
  * blog post contents is a sequence of words without any meaning (apparently &#8216;baeyens&#8217; has become part of a standard splog dictionary) 
  * at the end of the blog post is an `iframe` part 
  * the `iframe` inserts code from www.webs-search.com in the page that also redirects the browser to e.g. http://www.webs-search.com/search.php?key=guns (if the blog topic was &#8216;guns&#8217;) 
  * that page is filled with ads that go through www.peakclick.com, an Austrian PPC site 

What I mean is: [Dave](http://www.sifry.com/alerts/), you guys should be able to filter this scum out! And [Matt](http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/), can&#8217;t you give the Blogger team a hand in attacking the splog problem from their side? We don&#8217;t want Technorati installing a `if (domain ends in "blogspot.com") {/* treat as splog */ ... }` rule, do we? Or do we?

### webs-search.com

  * domain is registered by a &#8220;Anrev, Kovacz contact@mwayc.com &#8211; 1003 Star Street &#8211; Novambark, na 88737363 &#8211; CA&#8221; 
  * the registration address for mwayc.com is &#8220;41 State Street &#8211; New York, NY 12345 &#8211; US&#8221; 
  * domain is hosted on an EV1 server: ev1s-67-15-104-73.ev1servers.net [67.15.104.73]
  * the page title is _&#8216;Licht und tonanlage&#8217;_, which could mean that either the above Kovacz speaks German, or -more probable- that the site&#8217;s code was delivered by the Austrian PPC site.
